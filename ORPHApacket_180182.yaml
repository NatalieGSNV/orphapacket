- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare breast malformation characterized by the presence of accessory
      breasts with a complete ductal system, areola, and nipple in addition to two
      normal breasts. The accessory breast tissue mostly lies along the milk lines.
      It is often not recognized until puberty, when it begins to respond to regular
      hormonal fluctuations, and may develop the same changes as normal breasts throughout
      life.
