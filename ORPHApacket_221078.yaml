  - Contents: Combined hyperactive dysfunction syndrome of the cranial nerves is a
      rare, acquired peripheral neuropathy characterized by symptoms arising from
      combined overactivity in cranial nerves, without any explanatory structural
      lesion. The symptoms may be unilateral or bilateral, may occur synchronously
      or metachronously, and include trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm and glossopharyngeal
      neuralgia.
