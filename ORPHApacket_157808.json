Typical histopathological findings include fibromatosis-like proliferation in the soft tissues with cystic or dysplastic lesions. Neurofibromatosis and osteofibrous dysplasia are frequently associated."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"609143","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Congenital pseudarthrosis of the limbs"}]}]}]}
