- TextSection:
  - Contents: Larsen-like syndrome, lethal type, is characterised by multiple joint
      dislocation and respiratory insufficiency due to tracheomalacia and/or lung
      hypoplasia. It has been described in less than ten patients. Transmission is
      thought to be autosomal recessive. Brain dysplasia has been described in some
      patients and could result from systemic hypoxic-ischemic insults during the
      second half of pregnancy, although genetic factors have not been ruled out.
