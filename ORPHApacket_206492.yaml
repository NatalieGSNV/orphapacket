  - Contents: Vulvovaginal rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare vulvovaginal tumour, a highly
      malignant soft tissue sarcoma composed of cells with round to oval or spindle-shaped
      nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm that may show differentiation towards striated
      muscle cells. It usually affects children and presents with a vulvar or vaginal
      mass that may be polypoid or grape-like (embryonal subtype) and associated with
      bleeding and ulceration.
