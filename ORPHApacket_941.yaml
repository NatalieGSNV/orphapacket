- TextSection:
  - Contents: D-glyceric aciduria is a metabolic disorder characterized by D-glyceric
      acid excretion. It has been described in several patients. Clinical findings
      include progressive neurological impairment, hypotonia, seizures, failure to
      thrive and metabolic acidosis. Some patients had hyperglycinemia secondary to
      the organic acidemia. However, some of the reported patients were asymptomatic.
      D-glyceric aciduria is caused by D-glycerate kinase deficiency. The <I>GLYCTK</I>
      gene has been mapped to 3p21.
