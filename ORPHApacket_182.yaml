- TextSection:
  - Contents: Chromomycosis is a chronic cutaneous and subcutaneous fungal infection,
      found mainly in subtropical and tropical areas (in soil and plant debris and
      transmitted by traumatic inoculation), and characterized clinically by slow
      growing, verrucous nodules, squamous plaques, or chronic limited lesions which
      are most commonly found on the lower limbs and which are characterized histologically
      by the presence of muriform cells. It is caused by dematiaceous fungi, with
      the main etiological agents being <i>Fonsecaea pedrosoi</i>, <i>Phialophora
      verrucosa</i> and <i>Cladophialophora carrionii</i>. Rarely, it can be caused
      by <i>Rhinocladiella aquaspersa</i>.
