Possible manifestations of the underlying cholangiopathy include epigastric pain and impaired liver function. Severity of CBD dilatation appears to correlate with the duration of ketamine consumption and the condition has been reported to be reversible in abstinent patients."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"4","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000738","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000738","HPOTerm":"Hallucinations","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002027","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002027","HPOTerm":"Abdominal pain","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0012440","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0012440","HPOTerm":"Abnormal biliary tract morphology","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0100518","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0100518","HPOTerm":"Dysuria","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
