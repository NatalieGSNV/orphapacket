Unlike PXE, these skin lesions show select elimination (absence or marked loss) of elastic fibers in the papillary dermis and there is no systemic involvement."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"PXE-like papillary dermal elastolysis"}]}]}]}
