  - Contents: Familial episodic pain syndrome with predominantly upper body involvement
      is a subtype of familial episodic pain syndrome characterized by episodes of
      severe debilitating pain mainly affecting shoulders, thorax and arms (occasionally
      radiating to the abdomen and legs), triggered by fasting, fatigue, cold temperatures
      or physical exercise, which last for 60-90 min and respond poorly to conventional
      analgesia. Intense pain episodes are accompanied by dyspnea, tachycardia, sweating,
      generalized pallor, peribuccal cyanosis, and stiffness of the abdominal wall
      and are followed by a period of exhaustion and somnolence.
