- TextSection:
  - Contents: Immunodeficiency due to ficolin3 deficiency is a rare, genetic, immunodeficiency
      due to a complement cascade protein anomaly characterized by low or undetectable
      serum ficolin3 levels, susceptibility to infections, and possibly autoimmunity.
      The presentation is variable, from perinatal necrotizing enterocolitis and recurrent
      skin infections with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> to childhood-onset recurrent
      pulmonary infections leading to brain abscesses and pulmonary fibrosis, to membranous
      nephropathy. In some patients, clinical consequences of ficolin3 deficiency
      were not clear.
