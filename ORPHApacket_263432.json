It is usually diagnosed in early infancy and in early adolescence. Nevus of Ito may progressively enlarge and darken in color (particularly with puberty) and its appearance usually remains stable once adulthood is reached. Spontaneous regression does not occur. Malignant melanoma has rarely been reported within a nevus of Ito. It shares the clinical features of nevus of Ota, except its anatomic location and in rare occasions, mayoccur together with the latter."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Nevus fuscocaeruleus acromiodeltoideus"}]}]}]}
