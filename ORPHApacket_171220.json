Commonly it presents in childhood with symptoms of recurrent urinary tract infections, gastroenteritis, obstruction, perianal sepsis and rectal bleeding. Drainage of mucus or pus from the anus is also a typical presenting sign. The majority are found in the retro-rectal space where they communicate with, or are contiguous to, the rectum."}]}]}
