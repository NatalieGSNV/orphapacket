- TextSection:
  - Contents: Hypertension due to gain-of-function mutations in the mineralocorticoid
      receptor is a rare genetic hypertension characterized by a familial severe hypertension
      with an onset before age 20 years, associated with suppressed plasma renin and
      low aldosterone levels in the presence of low or normal levels of the mineralocorticoid
      aldosterone, that is highly resistant to antihypertensive medication. During
      pregnancy, there is a marked exacerbation of hypertension, accompanied by low
      serum potassium levels and undetectable aldosterone levels, but without signs
      of preeclampsia, requiring early delivery.
