Nerve biopsy reveals both axonal and demyelinating changes and nerve conduction velocities vary from the demyelinating to axonal range (typically between 25-50m\/sec)."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614455","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"No data available"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"CMTDIE"},{"lang":"en","label":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-nephropathy syndrome"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"inverted formin, FH2 and WH2 domain containing"}],"Symbol":"INF2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"23791"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"610982"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
