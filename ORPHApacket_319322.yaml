- TextSection:
  - Contents: Mucinous tubular and spindle cell renal carcinoma is a rare subtype
      of renal cell carcinoma characterized, histologically, by tubular architecture
      and sheets of spindle cells embedded in a mucinous/myxoid stroma and, macroscopically,
      by a solid, generally well-circumscribed, partially encapsulated tumor of variable
      size, with a homogenously colored, bulging cut surface, occassionally containing
      areas of hemorrhage or necrosis, usually located in the cortex. Patients can
      present abdominal/flank pain, adbominal mass and/or hematuria, however most
      are asymptomatic and tumor is discovered incidentally. Indolent behavior is
      frequent and association with nephrolithiasis and end-stage kidney disease has
      been noted.
