It most frequently affects permanent molar teeth. Taurodontism increases the risk of pulp exposure. It can be isolated or associated with certain syndromes such as Down syndrome, amelogenesis imperfecta, and Klinefelter syndrome (see these terms)."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"272700","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"2","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000679","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000679","HPOTerm":"Taurodontia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000682","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000682","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of dental enamel","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
