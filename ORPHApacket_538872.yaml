- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum disease characterized by a solitary,
      erythematous, ulcerated plaque, which lacks the violaceous border typically
      present in classic pyoderma gangrenosum, usually affecting individuals who are
      otherwise healthy. Histologically, the lesion presents a central layer containing
      neutrophilic inflamation, surrounded by a palisade of histiocytes, which are
      rimmed by a lymphocytic infiltrate. In comparison with the other variants of
      pyoderma gangrenosum, this subtype usually shows a good response to less aggressive
      treatments and underlying systemic disorders are less frequently associated.
      It is considered the most benign and uncommon clinical variant of pyoderma gangrenosum.
