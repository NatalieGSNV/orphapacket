  - Contents: Macrocephaly-intellectual disability-left ventricular non compaction
      syndrome is a rare, genetic, syndromic intellectual disability characterized
      by motor and cognitive developmental delay with language impairment, macrocephaly,
      hypotonia, dysmorphic facial features (including long face, slanting palpebral
      fissures and prominent, flattened nose) and left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy.
      Patients also present skeletal abnormalities (e.g. scoliosis, finger clinodactyly,
      pes planus), slender build and shy behavior. Strabismus and various neurological
      signs (including ataxia, tremor and hyperreflexia) may be associated, as well
      as epilepsy, autism and MRI findings showing a small cerebellum and abnormalities
      of the corpus callosum. A phenotypic variant with no cardiac involvement has
      been reported.
