Tumors are often diagnosed incidentally in early stages, although complications caused by renal cysts (dull flank or abdominal pain, fever) or renal parenchymal bleeding may mask the underlying neoplastic process. Most have an indolent behavior."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Elderly"}]}]}]}]}
