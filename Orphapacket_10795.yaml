- TextSection:
  - Contents: Argyria is a rare dermatosis, which can be either localized or systemic,
      that occurs after prolonged contact and absorption of silver containing compounds
      over a period of years and that is characterized by irreversible blue-gray to
      gray-black staining of skin, fingernails and/or mucous membranes, most evident
      on sun exposed areas of the skin. Silver exposure is usually occupational but
      may also occur through dental amalgams, the ingestion of colloidal silver, acupuncture
      needles, orthopedic implants and topical medications (such as silver sulfadiazine).
