The origin of synovial sarcoma is likely from multipotent mesenchymal cells and not synovium (contrary to its name)."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"300813","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Synovialosarcoma"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"3","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"SS18 subunit of BAF chromatin remodeling complex"}],"Symbol":"SS18","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"11340"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"600192"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317348","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Part of a fusion gene in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"SSX family member 1"}],"Symbol":"SSX1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"11335"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"312820"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317348","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Part of a fusion gene in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"SSX family member 2"}],"Symbol":"SSX2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"11336"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"300192"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317348","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Part of a fusion gene in"}]}]}]}]}]}
