- TextSection:
  - Contents: Muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency (PGAMD) is a metabolic myopathy
      characterised by exercise-induced cramp, myoglobinuria, and presence of tubular
      aggregates in the muscle biopsy. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are increased
      between episodes of myoglobinuria. Less than 50 cases have been described so
      far. The disease is due to an anomaly in one of the last steps of glycolysis.
      The enzymatic defect in PGAMD is caused by mutations in the cDNA coding for
      the M-isoform of PGAM. Residual PGAM activity in the muscles of patients (2%-6%)
      is due to activity of the B-isoform. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Differential
      diagnosis includes muscle phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) and phosphofructokinase
      deficiency (PFKD) (see these terms).
