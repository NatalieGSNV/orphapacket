The two main subtypes are congenital partial pulmonary venous return anomaly (PAPVC; see this term), where one or a few of the pulmonary veins are anomalous, and congenital total pulmonary venous return anomaly (TAPVC, see this term), where all of the pulmonary veins are anomalous."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Congenital pulmonary venous connection anomaly"}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"4","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0001671","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001671","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the cardiac septa","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002093","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002093","HPOTerm":"Respiratory insufficiency","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002564","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002564","HPOTerm":"Malformation of the heart and great vessels","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0010772","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0010772","HPOTerm":"Anomalous pulmonary venous return","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
