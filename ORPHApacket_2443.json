Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder due to nuclear DNA anomalies includes diseases classified according to defects in: genes encoding structural components of OXPHOS complexes (such as Leigh syndrome, coenzyme Q10 deficiency); genes encoding assembly factors of OXPHOS complexes (such as GRACILE syndrome); genes altering the stability of mitochondrial DNA (such as autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia, mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome); mitochondrial protein synthesis (see these terms)."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder due to nDNA anomalies"},{"lang":"en","label":"OXPHOS disease due to nDNA anomalies"},{"lang":"en","label":"OXPHOS disease due to nuclear DNA anomalies"}]}]}]}
