  - Contents: Vasoproliferative tumor of the retina is a rare, benign, retinal vascular
      disease characterized by solitary or multiple, unilateral or bilateral, intra-retinal
      tumor(s), usually located in the peripheral infero-temporal quadrant, and often
      associated with sub- and intraretinal exudates, epiretinal membranes, exudative
      retinal detachment and cystoid macular edema, as well as, occasionally, retinal
      and vitreous hemorrhage. Patients may present with visual loss, floaters, and/or
      photopsia. Association with various conditions, such as retinitis pigmentosa,
      congenital retinal toxoplasmosis, retinopathy of prematurity, or coloboma, has
      been reported.
