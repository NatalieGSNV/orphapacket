Cognitive function is normal or only slightly impaired and retinitis pigmentosa has been reported in a few patients. Many survive into early adulthood, but ultimately succumb to cardiorespiratory insufficiency."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"252605","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"ML 3 gamma"},{"lang":"en","label":"ML III gamma"},{"lang":"en","label":"Mucolipidosis type 3 gamma"}]}]}]}
