Presenting symptoms are typically non-specific and include abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting, nausea, and\/or, less commonly, jaundice. Immunohistochemical evidence of acinar-specific products is observed. Association with Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and pancreatic panniculitis has been reported."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma"}]}]}]}
