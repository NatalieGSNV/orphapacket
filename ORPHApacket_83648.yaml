  - Contents: X-linked recessive intellectual disability-macrocephaly-ciliary dysfunction
      syndrome combining intellectual deficit, ciliary dysfunction and macrocephalus
      has been described in several males from one large family. Ciliary dysfunction
      leads to recurrent pulmonary infections and death in most cases. This syndrome
      is a recessive X-liked mental retardation and has been associated with mutations
      in the <i>OFD1</i> gene, known to be involved in oral-facial-digital syndrome.
