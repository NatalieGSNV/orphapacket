Severe short staure and brachydactyly have been reported in a few patients with MJD."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"613342","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Unknown"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Mseleni joint disease"}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"12","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000938","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000938","HPOTerm":"Osteopenia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000944","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000944","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the metaphysis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001156","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001156","HPOTerm":"Brachydactyly","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001367","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001367","HPOTerm":"Abnormal joint morphology","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001369","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001369","HPOTerm":"Arthritis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002815","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002815","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the knee","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0003019","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0003019","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the wrist","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0003272","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0003272","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the hip bone","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0003312","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0003312","HPOTerm":"Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0004322","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0004322","HPOTerm":"Short stature","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0005930","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0005930","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of epiphysis morphology","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0009811","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0009811","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the elbow","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
