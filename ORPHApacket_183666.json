Autoimmune manifestations (including immune cytopenias, arthritis and hepatitis) are occasionally associated. Immunologic findings reveal absent immunoglobulin class switch recombination and lack of defect of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations in the presence of normal numbers of CD27+ memory B cells."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"3","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"605258","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"608106","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"608184","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"HIGM without susceptibility to opportunistic infections"}]}],"HasSubtypeList":[{"Subtype":[{"Disorder":[{"ORPHA":"101089","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Hyper-IgM syndrome type 2"}],"PURL":"http:\/\/www.orpha.net\/ORDO\/Orphanet_101089","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"activation induced cytidine deaminase"}],"Symbol":"AICDA","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"13203"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"605257"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"ORPHA":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]},{"Disorder":[{"ORPHA":"101091","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Hyper-IgM syndrome type 4"}],"PURL":"http:\/\/www.orpha.net\/ORDO\/Orphanet_101091"}]},{"Disorder":[{"ORPHA":"101092","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Hyper-IgM syndrome type 5"}],"PURL":"http:\/\/www.orpha.net\/ORDO\/Orphanet_101092","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"uracil DNA glycosylase"}],"Symbol":"UNG","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"12572"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"191525"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"ORPHA":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
