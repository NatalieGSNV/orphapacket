- TextSection:
  - Contents: Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare small intestinal malignancy,
      most commonly located in the duodenum (55% of cases) but also rarely in the
      jejunum and ileum, which is usually discovered at an advanced stage in the 6th
      to 7th decade of life due to non-specific symptoms at presentation such as nausea,
      abdominal pain and weight loss. In some cases it is asymptomatic, and therefore
      usually has a poor prognosis.
