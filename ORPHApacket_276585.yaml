- TextSection:
  - Contents: Diazoxide-resistant hyperinsulism (DRH) is form of congenital isolated
      hyperinsulism (see this term) caused by an abnormal insulin production by b-cells
      in the pancreas that can be diffuse or focal and is characterized by an excessive/
      uncontrolled insulin secretion (inappropriate for the level of glycemia), recurrent
      episodes of profound hypoglycemia and resistance to medical management with
      diazoxide.
