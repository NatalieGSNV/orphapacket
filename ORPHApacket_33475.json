Neck stiffness and photophobia are often absent in infants and young children who may manifest nonspecific signs such as irritability, inconsolable crying, poor feeding, and a bulging fontanel. Meningococcal meningitis may also present as part of early or late onset sepsis in neonates. The disease is potentially fatal. Surviving patients may develop neurological sequelae that include sensorineural hearing loss, seizures, spasticity, attention deficits and intellectual disability."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
