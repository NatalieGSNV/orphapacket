- TextSection:
  - Contents: High-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the corpus uteri is an extremely
      rare, aggressive, primary uterine neoplasm, originating from neuroendocrine
      cells scattered within the endometrium, characterized, macroscopically, by a
      bulky, frequently polypoid, mass with abundant necrosis located in the uterus
      and, histologically, by rosette-like and cord-like structures consisting of
      small, rounded cells with oval nuclei and scarce cytoplasm. Patients often present
      with dysfunctional uterine bleeding, pelvic or abdominal mass and, especially
      in later stages of the disease, abdominal pain. Symptomatic metastatic spread
      or symptoms related to a paraneoplastic syndrome, such as retinopathy, or Cushing
      syndrome due to ectopic ACTH production, may be associated.
