Indeed, the occurrence of congenital infection with EBV has never been demonstrated conclusively and must be very rare. One case have been reported to present after birth, multiple congenital anomalies (micrognathia, cryptorchidism, central cataracts), dystrophy, generalized hypotonia, hepatosplenomegaly, diffuse petechiae and hematomas and multiple areas of metaphysitis of the long bones at birth. A low birth weight was also reported.
