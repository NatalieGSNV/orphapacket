Onset of symptoms is neonatal or a few months after birth and includes hypoglycemia associated with acute episodes of severe lactic acidosis, progressive neurological deterioration, severe liver failure, renal tubular acidosis and Fanconi syndrome. Patients also present progressive multisystem damage with failure to thrive, muscular weakness and hypotonia, developmental delay with seizures, spasticity, lethargy, microcephaly and cardiomyopathy. To date, there is no conclusive evidence of the existence of an isolated form of this disorder."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"261650","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"261680","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Mitochondrial inheritance"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"PEPCK deficiency"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"2","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1"}],"Symbol":"PCK1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"8724"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614168"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2, mitochondrial"}],"Symbol":"PCK2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"8725"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614095"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
