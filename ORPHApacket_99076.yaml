- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, congenital anomaly of the great arteries characterized by an
      extrapericardial vessel arising from the ascending aorta proximal to the brachiocephalic
      artery and terminating either in the dorsal aorta or in pulmonary arteries via
      a persistently patent arterial duct. The resulting connection is a systemic-to-systemic
      or systemic-to-pulmonary. Clinical manifestation include exercise intolerance,
      reduced femoral pulses, cyanosis with or without pulmonary hypertension and
      heart failure. Other congenital cardiovascular anomalies are often present and
      influence the clinical presentation.
