Clinical features depend on the anatomic variability of the lesion and patients may be minimally symptomatic, severely cyanotic or may develop congestive heart failure. PA-VSD may represent a severe form of Tetralogy of Fallot (see this term)."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"178370","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}]}]}
