- TextSection:
  - Contents: Ataxia-telangiectasia variant is a rare, genetic, persistent combined
      dystonia characterized by clinical signs similar to ataxia-telangiectasia but
      with a later (usually adulthood) onset and slower progression. Patients typically
      present extrapyramidal signs, such as resting tremor, choreathetosis, and dystonia,
      as the initial symptoms and later often develop mild cerebellar ataxia (with
      gait usually preserved). Telangiectasia and immunodeficiency may be absent but
      secondary features of ataxia-telangiectasia, such as risk of malignancy, dysarthria
      and peripheral neuropathy, are frequently present.
