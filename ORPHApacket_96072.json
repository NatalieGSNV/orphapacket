It has a highly variable phenotype, principally characterized by psychomotor and language delay, seizures and dysmorphic features such as high forehead with frontal bossing, hypertelorism, prominent glabella, long narrow palpebral fissures, low set ears and short neck. Eye abnormalities (glaucoma, irregular iris pigmentation, hyperopia) have also been reported."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"4","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Distal duplication 4p"},{"lang":"en","label":"Distal trisomy 4p"},{"lang":"en","label":"Telomeric duplication 4p"},{"lang":"en","label":"Trisomy 4pter"}]}]}]}
