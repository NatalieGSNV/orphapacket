Intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism (e.g. frontal bossing, abnormal palpebral fissures, strabismus, abnormally shaped ears, and micrognathia), and genital anomalies (e.g. undescended testes) have also been observed. It has been reported to be associated with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7, resulting in a Silver-Russell syndrome phenotype. Cases with no associated malformations have also been reported."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Antenatal"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Mosaic trisomy chromosome 7"},{"lang":"en","label":"Trisomy 7 mosaicism"}]}]}]}
