- TextSection:
  - Contents: Chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) is an immunologically mediated photodermatosis
      usually observed in temperate climates and that typically develops in middle-aged
      to elderly males. CAD is characterized by eczematous and often lichenified pruritic
      patches and confluent plaques located predominantly on sun-exposed areas with
      notable sparing of eyelids, skin folds, and postauricular skin. It is often
      accompanied by multiple contact allergies and usually occurs in a background
      of either atopic, contact allergic, or seborrheic dermatitis, although it can
      occur <i>de novo</i>. Resolution of photosensitivity is reported in up to 50%
      of individuals after 15 years or more, with contact allergies persisting.
