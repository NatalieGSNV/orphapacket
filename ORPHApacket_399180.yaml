  - Contents: A rare osteonecrosis disease characterized by death of bone cellular
      components secondary to an interruption of the subchondral blood supply, typically
      manifesting with unilateral or bilateral, unifocal or multifocal lesions usually
      located on the epiphysis, metaphysis and/or diaphysis of the femoral heads,
      knees, shoulders, ankles and/or wrists, leading to gradual onset of pain and
      progressive joint degeneration resulting in loss of function. Association with
      corticosteroid usage, alcoholism, hyperbaric events, radiation or cytotoxic
      agent exposure, hemoglobinopathies, and/or underlying autoimmune or metabolic
      disease, amongst others, has been observed.
