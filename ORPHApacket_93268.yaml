  - Contents: Short rib-polydactyly syndrome (SRPS), Beemer-Langer type is an extremely
      rare type of SRPS developing prenatally or immediately after birth and characterized
      by short and narrow thorax with horizontally oriented ribs. Other bone features
      include small iliac bones, short tubular bones, bowing of long bones and rarely
      pre- and post-axial polydactyly. Brain defects are common and some cases of
      cleft lip, absent internal genitalia and renal, biliary and pancreatic cysts
      have been reported. The course is rapidly fatal.
