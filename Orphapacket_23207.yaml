- TextSection:
  - Contents: Squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder and extrahepatic biliary
      tract is a rare hepatic and biliary tract tumor, arising either in the gallbladder
      itself or in the epithelium lining the extrahepatic biliary tree, the cystic
      duct and peribiliary glands. It is characterized by a substantial keratinization
      with abundant keratohyalin pearls and central deposition of dense keratin material
      within infiltrative nests and locally aggressive nature. In the early stages
      of the disease symptoms are vague and nonspecific (abdominal pain, jaundice
      and vomiting). In the advanced stages it may present with a bulky tumor and
      symptoms of adjacent organ involvement.
