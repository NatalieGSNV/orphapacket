- TextSection:
  - Contents: Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is an ophthalmoplegic syndrome, affecting all age
      groups, characterized by acute attacks (lasting a few days to a few weeks) of
      periorbital pain, ipsilateral ocular motor nerve palsies, ptosis, disordered
      eye movements and blurred vision usually caused by a non-specific inflammatory
      process in the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure. It has an unpredicatable
      course with spontaneous remission occurring in some and recurrence of attacks
      in others.
