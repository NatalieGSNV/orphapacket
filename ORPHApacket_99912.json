Malignant dysgerminomatous germ cell tumor of ovary responds well to chemotherapy, potentially sparing patients from infertility and early mortality."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Unknown"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Dysgerminomatous germ cell cancer of the ovary"},{"lang":"en","label":"Malignant ovarian dysgerminoma"}]}]}]}
