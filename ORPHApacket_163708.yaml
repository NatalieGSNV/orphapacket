      characterized by late-onset (after 1 year old) epileptic spasms that ocurr in
      clusters, associated with tonic seizures, atypical absences and cognitive deterioration.

      by a temporal, or temporofrontal, slow wave or spike focus combined with synchronous
      spike-waves and no hypsarrhythmia or background activity.
