- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare soft tissue sarcoma originating from vascular endothelial cells,
      histologically typically characterized by irregular vascular spaces lined by
      atypical endothelial cells (in well differentiated tumors) or sheets of spindle
      cells or epithelioid shaped cells with increased mitotic activity (in poorly
      differentiated tumors). The tumor arises preferentially in elderly individuals
      in superficial soft tissues and skin, with a predilection for the head and neck
      region, although all areas of the body may be affected. Macroscopically it typically
      presents as an ill-defined violaceous plaque which may develop a thicker, nodular
      surface, including ulceration and hemorrhage as the disease progresses. Angiosarcomas
      are very aggressive tumors with poor prognosis.
