- TextSection:
  - Contents: Coloboma of superior eyelid is a rare developmental defect during embryogenesis
      characterized by a typically unilateral, partial or full-thickness, variably
      sized defect of the superior eyelid, ranging from a small notch to complete
      absence of the entire lid, which is commonly triangular in shape (with base
      at eyelid margin) and located on the medial third of the lid. It can occur isolated,
      associated with other anomalies (e.g. ocular/orbital and facial), or as part
      of a syndrome.
