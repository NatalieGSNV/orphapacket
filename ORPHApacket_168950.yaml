- TextSection:
  - Contents: Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm associated with PDGFRB rearrangement is a
      rare, malignant, neoplastic disease characterized by clonal proliferation of
      myeloid and/or lymphoid precursors harboring rearrangements in the PDGFRB gene,
      in the blood, bone marrow and often other tissues as well (spleen, lymph nodes,
      skin, etc.). It usually presents as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia,
      chronic eosinophilic leukemia, atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, juvenile
      myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia or
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients usually present with anemia, leukocytosis,
      monocytosis, eosinophilia and/or splenomegaly, or systemic symptoms, such as
      fever, sweating and/or weight loss.
