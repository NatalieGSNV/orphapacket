- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, genetic, autosomal recessive axonal hereditary motor and sensory
      neuropathy disease characterized by prenatal onset of a severe sensorimotor
      axonal polyneuropathy (reflected by reduced fetal movement and polyhydramnios),
      manifesting, at birth, with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation,
      profound muscular hypotonia, rapidly progressing distal muscle weakness, and
      absent deep tendon reflexes, in the absence of contractures, leading to death
      before 8 months of age. Neuropathological findings show severe loss of large-
      and medium-sized myelinated fibers without signs of demyelination.
