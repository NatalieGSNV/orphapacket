- TextSection:
  - Contents: "Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma is a rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma,\
      \ originating from the intercalating cells of the collecting ducts and macroscopically\
      \ manifesting as a well-circumscribed, highly lobulated, solid tumor that is\
      \ usually diagnosed at an early stage. It is frequently asymptomatic, or may\
      \ present with nonspecific symptoms, such as weight loss, fever or fatigue.\
      \ The classic presentation observed in renal tumors (hematuria, flank pain and\
      \ palpable mass) is occasionally observed and usually indicates an advanced\
      \ stage of the disease. It is most frequently sporadic however, several familial\
      \ cases, associated with Birt-Hogg Dub\xE9 syndrome, have been described."
