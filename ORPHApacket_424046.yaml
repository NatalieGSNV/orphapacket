- TextSection:
  - Contents: A very rare, malignant, epithelial tumor of the pancreas characterized,
      macroscopically, by a usually large, well-circumscribed, fully or partially
      encapsulated, solid mass, often with hemorrhage, necrosis and cystic changes,
      in any portion of the pancreas and, histologically, by neoplastic cells with
      variable degrees of differentiation and morphology, ranging from acinar structures
      similar to normal pancreatic acini to large sheets of poorly differentiated
      neoplastic cells. Presenting symptoms are typically non-specific and include
      abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting, nausea, and/or, less commonly, jaundice.
      Immunohistochemical evidence of acinar-specific products is observed. Association
      with Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and pancreatic panniculitis
      has been reported.
