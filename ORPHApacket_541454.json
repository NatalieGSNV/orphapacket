Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest\/death at any age (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death therefore surgical revascularization is recommended only when signs and\/or symptoms of ischemia are present."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"AORCA"},{"lang":"en","label":"R-ACAOS"},{"lang":"en","label":"Right coronary artery from left aortic sinus"}]}]}]}
