- TextSection:
  - Contents: Intraneural perineurioma is a rare tumor of cranial and spinal nerves
      arising from peripheral nerve sheet and composed exclusively or predominantly
      of cells showing perineurial differentiation. It presents as a localized, tubular
      or fusiform enlargement of a nerve or nerve segment, usually in the extremities
      or the trunk, associated with a motor-predominant mononeuropathy including slow,
      painless, gradual loss of motor function in the involved nerve trunk with muscle
      weakness and atrophy and, rarely, sensory dysfunction. Cranial nerve involvement
      is rare.
