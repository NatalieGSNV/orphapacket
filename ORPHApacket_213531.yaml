- TextSection:
  - Contents: Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a rare, aggressive subtype of
      invasive breast carcinoma characterized by rapid growth, relatively large tumor
      size and a tendency to metastasize to distant organs, particularly the lungs,
      with relatively less frequent involvement of the axillary lymph nodes. Histologically,
      the tumor shows high-grade cellularity and heterologous differentiation, including
      chondroid, osseous, pleomorphic/sarcomatoid, spindled, and squamous elements.
      Patients usually present with a fast-growing, large, well-circumscribed, mobile
      lump in the breast, which can become painful and involve the chest wall and
      the skin, leading to ulceration.
