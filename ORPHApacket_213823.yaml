  - Contents: A rare, highly aggressive uterine cancer, macroscopically appearing
      as an irregular, slow-growing, non-friable, polypoid mass on the uterine cervix
      and histologically showing a pseudoglandular or cribriform growth pattern. It
      presents with vaginal bleeding and discharge and abdominal or pelvic pain. The
      tumor is highly infiltrative, often associated with vascular, lymphatic and
      perineural invasion, with subsequent haematogenous spread and early recurrence.
