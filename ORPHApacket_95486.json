The severity of symptoms is related to the degree and rate of ductal constriction and ranges from mild postnatal respiratory distress to development of ventricular failure with fetal hydrops and intrauterine death or severe cardiopulmonary compromise in the postnatal period. It may be associated with a prenatal exposure to cyclooxygenase inhibitors or corticosteroids."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Premature closure of the patent ductus arteriosus"}]}]}]}
