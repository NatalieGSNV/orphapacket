It may present with exertional dyspnea, fatigue, cough, hemoptysis, palpitation and chest pain, but may also be asymptomatic. In serious cases, trachea constriction due to postural changes may lead to attacks of cyanosis with severe dyspnea. Sudden cardiac death has been reported in some cases."}]}]}
