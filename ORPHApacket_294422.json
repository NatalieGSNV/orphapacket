CIF may be the result of congenital digestive diseases (such as gastroschisis, atresia of small intestine), short bowel syndrome, intra-abdominal or pelvic cancer, or progressive and devastating gastrointestinal or systemic benign diseases (such as Crohn disease)."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"CIF"}]}]}]}
