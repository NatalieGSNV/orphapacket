- TextSection:
  - Contents: Familial clubfoot with or without associated lower limb anomalies is
      a rare congenital limb malformation syndrome characterized by malalignment of
      the bones and joints of the foot and ankle, with presence of forefoot and midfoot
      adductus, hindfoot varus, and ankle equinus, presenting as rigid inward turning
      of the foot towards the midline, in various members of a single family. Hypoplasia
      of lower leg muscles is a frequently associated finding. Patients may present
      with other low-limb malformations, such as patellar hypoplasia, oblique talus,
      tibial hemimelia, and polydactyly.
