The severe form is characterized by delayed psychomotor development, seizures, early-onset hypotonia, and persistently increased lactate levels. The mild form usually presents with irritability, psychomotor regression after six months of age, and temporary high lactate levels, with overall clinical improvement from the second year onward."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614924","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"No data available"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"COXPD12"},{"lang":"en","label":"Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 12"},{"lang":"en","label":"LTBL"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"glutamyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial"}],"Symbol":"EARS2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"29419"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"612799"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
