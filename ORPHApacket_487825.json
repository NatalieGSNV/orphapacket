Additionally, distinct craniofacial dysmorphic features, notably a broad face with high forehead, high anterior hairline, narrow palpebral fissures that take on a crescent moon shape when smiling, broad nasal bridge and tip with anteverted nostrils, mild midfacial hypoplasia, long, smooth philtrum, thin upper lip vermillion, small, widely spaced teeth and flat occiput\/microcephaly\/brachycephaly, are also chararteristic. Over time, fat pads may become less prominent and disappear."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"602342","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Plantar lipomatosis-facial dysmorphism-developmental delay syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Plantar lipomatosis-unusual facies-developmental delay syndrome"}]}]}]}
