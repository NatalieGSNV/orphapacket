- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndrome disease characterized by segmental
      and progressive overgrowth, predominantly involving the adipose tissue, or a
      mixture of adipose and fibrous tissue, with variable involvement of subcutaneous
      and muscular tissue, as well as skeletal overgrowth. Overgrowth severity and
      range is highly variable, although frequently it is asymmetric and disproportionate,
      it affects lower extremities more than the upper ones, and progresses in a distal
      to proximal patten. Congenital overgrowth is typically associated.
