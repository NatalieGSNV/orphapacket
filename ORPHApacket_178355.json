The clinical and skeletal features are similar to those seen in the allelic disorder Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMC; see this term), but can be distinguished from this syndrome by the absence of intellectual deficiency and microcephaly in SMC."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"607326","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"615222","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"2","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"dymeclin"}],"Symbol":"DYM","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"21317"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"607461"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410295","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (loss of function) in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"RAB33B, member RAS oncogene family"}],"Symbol":"RAB33B","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"16075"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"605950"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
