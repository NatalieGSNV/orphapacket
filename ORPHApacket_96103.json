Short stature and seizures, as well as cardiac (e.g. atrial septal defect), skeletal (incl. brachy\/syndactyly) and genital (e.g. micropenis, cryptorchidism) abnormalities may also be associated. Neurodevelopmental anomalies (pain insensitivity, sensorineural hearing loss, expressive language deficiency) and neuropsychiatric disorders (autistic features, auditory hallucination, self-talking) have also been reported."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Antenatal"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Distal duplication 11q"},{"lang":"en","label":"Telomeric duplication 11q"},{"lang":"en","label":"Trisomy 11qter"}]}]}]}
