- TextSection:
  - Contents: Bilateral choanal atresia is a congenital anomaly that is usually sporadic
      (but some familial cases have been reported), is more commonly seen in females
      than in males (2:1), and where the nose is blocked on both sides by bony or
      soft tissue formed during embryological development. It is characterized by
      respiratory distress relieved by crying and rhinorrhea that presents at birth.
