- TextSection:
  - Contents: Focal facial dermal dysplasias (FFDD) are rare ectodermal dysplasias,
      characterized by congenital bitemporal (resembling forceps marks) or preauricular
      scar-like lesions associated with additional facial and or systematic manifestations.
      4 types of FFDD are described (FFDD I to IV; see these terms). FFDD types II
      and III present with a variable facial dysmorphism including distichiasis (upper
      lashes) or lacking eyelashes, and upward slanting and thinned lateral eyebrows
      with a flattened nasal bridge and full upper lip. FFDD types I and IV are infrequently
      associated with extra-cutaneous anomalies.
