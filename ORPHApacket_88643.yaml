      syndrome is characterised by precocious obesity, congenital hypothyroidism,
      neonatal colitis, cardiac hypertrophy, craniosynostosis and developmental delay.
      It has been described in two brothers, one of whom died within the first month
      of life. The parents of the two children were nonconsanguineous and in good
      health, however, the pregnancies were complicated by a maternal HELLP syndrome
      (Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets). The mode of inheritance
      has not yet been clearly established.
