Severe disease is associated with multiple fractures, osteopenia, arachnodactyly and blue sclerae. A broad spectrum of additional features, including scoliosis, radio-ulnar synostosis, mild developmental delay, and various eye disorders (glaucoma, amblyopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, ptosis), are also reported."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"245600","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Multiple joint dislocations-short stature-craniofacial dysmorphism-congenital heart defects syndrome"}]}]}]}
