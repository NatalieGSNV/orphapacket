It may be due to various congenital or acquired causes, but it is most often secondary to an acquired inflammatory disease (i.e. Takayasu arteritis or giant cell arteritis)."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"5","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Coarctation of the abdominal aorta"},{"lang":"en","label":"Mid-aortic dysplastic syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Mid-aortic syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Midaortic syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Middle aortic syndrome"}]}]}]}
