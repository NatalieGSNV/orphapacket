- TextSection:
  - Contents: Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease
      (PAH-CHD) is a form of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, see this term),
      characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart
      failure occurring as a common complication of congenital heart malformations
      (see this term) with left to right cardiac shunts. Eisenmenger syndrome (see
      this term) is the most advanced form of PAH-CHD and is defined as the complete
      or partial reversal of an initial left-to-right shunt to a right-to-left shunt,
      causing cyanosis and limited exercise capacity. PAH-CHD also includes mild to
      moderate systemic-to-pulmonary shunts with no cyanosis at rest, patients with
      small defects, and those with residual PAH following corrective cardiac surgery.
