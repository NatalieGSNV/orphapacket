- TextSection:
  - Contents: 'Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Handigodu type is a rare, genetic,
      primary bone dysplasia disorder characterized by three distinct phenotypes,
      namely: 1) patients of average height with painful, osteoarthritic changes of
      the hip joints and no spinal abnormalities, 2) short-statured patients with
      predominantly truncal shortening, arm span exceeding height, dysplastic changes
      of hips and varying degrees of platyspondyly, and 3) patients with dwarfism,
      various associated skeletal abnormalities (particularly of the knees and hands)
      and severe epiphyseal dysplasia (of hips, knees, hands, wrists) associated with
      significant platyspondyly. Most patients cannot walk long distances, and many
      have decreased joint spaces, as well as sclerotic and cystic changes on imaging.'
