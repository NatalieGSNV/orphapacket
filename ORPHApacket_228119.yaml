- TextSection:
  - Contents: Fusariosis describes a superficial, locally invasive, disseminated infection
      with the pathogenic fungus species, <i>Fusarium</i>, often found in soil and
      water, which is mainly transmitted to humans through traumatic inoculation and
      that manifests with keratitis, onychomycosis and less frequently peritonitis
      and cellulitis. In the immunocompromised, disseminated fusariosis is more common
      and it manifests with refractory fever, skin lesions (ecthyma-like, target,
      and multiple subcutaneous nodules), severe myalgias and sino-pulmonary infections.
