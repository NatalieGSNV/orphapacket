- TextSection:
  - Contents: Loeffler's endocarditis is a rare restrictive cardiomyopathy (see this
      term) characterized by hypereosinophilia and fibrous thickening of the endocardium,
      with usually large thrombi against the ventricle walls, that can lead to cardiovascular
      complications such as heart failure and thromboembolism. It manifests with symptoms
      like edema, fatigue and shortness of breath. It is usually secondary to eosinophil-associated
      tissue damage and is associated with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome,
      chronic eosinophilic leukemia (see these terms), carcinoma, or lymphoma.
