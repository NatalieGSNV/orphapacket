  - Contents: Aortopulmonary coronary arterial course is a rare coronary artery congenital
      malformation characterized by anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the
      contralateral sinus of Valsalva with course between the aorta and the pulmonary
      artery. The anomaly is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death,
      especially during exercise.
