  - Contents: Carcinosarcoma of the cervix uteri is a rare, malignant, mixed epithelial
      and mesenchymal tumor, located in the cervix uteri, composed of an admixture
      of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. It usually presents with abnormal
      vaginal bleeding and a round, well-defined, grey to yellowish-white, pedunculated
      polypoid mass protruding through the cervical canal. Association with HPV infection
      (especially serotype 16) has been frequently reported.
