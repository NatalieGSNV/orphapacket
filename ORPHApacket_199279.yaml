- TextSection:
  - Contents: Familial angiolipomatosis is a rare, genetic, subcutaneous tissue disorder
      characterized by the presence of benign, usually multiple, subcutaneous tumors
      composed of adipose tissue and blood vessels, typically manifesting as yellow,
      firm, circumscribed, 1-4 cm in diameter tumors located in the arms, legs and
      trunk, with deep extension of the lesions between muscles, tendons and joint
      capsules (without infiltration of these structures), in several members of a
      single family. Tumors may be tender or mildly painful when palpated and do not
      regress spontaneously.
