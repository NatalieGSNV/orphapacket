  - Contents: Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is an acute arboviral infection caused
      by an <i>alphavirus</i> of the <i>Togaviridae</i> family transmitted by an infected
      mosquito, that is characterized by the onset of flulike symptoms including fever,
      chills, weakness, headache, vomiting, abdominal pain with diarrhea, myalgia,
      leucocytosis, and hematuria, rapidly progressing to diffuse central nervous
      system (CNS) involvement with confusion, somnolence, or even coma. Seizures,
      which may progress to status epilepticus and neurologic sequelae, cranial nerve
      palsies, and photophobia may occur. EEE is associated with a high rate of morbidity
