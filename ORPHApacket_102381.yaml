- TextSection:
  - Contents: A subgroup of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN), associated with
      treatment of an unrelated neoplastic disease with cytotoxic agents, like etoposid,
      doxorubicin, daunorubicin and others. The neoplastic cells often show rearrangements
      involving the mixed lineage leukemia gene at 11q23. This subgroup of t-MN is
      typically associated with overt leukemia, without preceding myelodysplastic
      syndrome, developing 2-3 years after exposure, presenting with non-specific
      symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue, bleeding and bruising,
      recurrent infections, bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement.
