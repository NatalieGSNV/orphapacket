- TextSection:
  - Contents: Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes related to topoisomerase
      type 2 inhibitor represent a subgroup of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN),
      associated with treatment of an unrelated neoplastic disease with cytotoxic
      agents, like etoposid, doxorubicin, daunorubicin and others. The neoplastic
      cells often show rearrangements involving the mixed lineage leukemia gene at
      11q23. This subgroup of t-MN is typically associated with overt leukemia, without
      preceding myelodysplastic syndrome, developing 2-3 years after exposure, presenting
      with non-specific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue, bleeding
      and bruising, recurrent infections, bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement.
