- TextSection:
  - Contents: Macular amyloidosis (MA) is a rare chronic form of cutaneous amyloidosis
      (see this term), a skin disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid
      deposits in the dermis, clinically characterized by pruritic hyperkeratotic
      gray-brown macules that give a rippled or reticulated pattern of pigmentation
      usually in the upper back and extensor sites of arms, forearms and legs, and
      histologically by the deposition of amyloid in the upper dermis and close to
      the basal cell layer of the epidermis. MA is commonly associated with other
      skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis.
