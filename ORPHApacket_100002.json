It presents as a well-circumscribed, rarely encapsulated mass, not associated with a recognizable nerve, most commonly arising in the dermis and subcutis of the extremities or trunk, or, rarely, in deep soft tissue or skin (e.g., in the stomach, kidney, pancreas, maxillary sinus, mandible, bronchial tree and the face).
