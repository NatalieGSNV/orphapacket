It is a poorly differentiated, aggressive variant of adenosquamous carcinoma that usually affects young women and presents with dysfunctional vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. Distant metastases to the lungs, liver spleen or bones are often present at the time of diagnosis. It is often associated with high-risk HPV-infection (types 18, 16 and 32)."}]}]}
