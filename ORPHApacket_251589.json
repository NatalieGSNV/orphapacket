Depending on the primary localization of the tumor, patients can present with signs of raised intracranial pressure (headache, vomiting, papilledema), seizures, progressive neurological deficits, and\/or behavioral changes. The tumor is most commonly localized in the frontal and temporal lobes, brain stem and spinal cord."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 2, mitochondrial"}],"Symbol":"IDH2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"5383"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"147650"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"465410","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Biomarker tested in"}]}]}]}]}]}
