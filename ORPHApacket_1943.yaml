- TextSection:
  - Contents: Infant epilepsy with migrant focal crisis is characterized by early-onset
      progressive encephalopathy with migrant, continuous myoclonus. Three cases have
      been reported. The focal continuous myoclonus appeared during the first months
      of life. Prolonged bilateral myoclonic seizures and generalized tonic-clonic
      seizures occurred later. Subsequently, a progressive encephalopathy with hypotonia
      and ataxia appeared. Cortical atrophy was revealed by computed tomography (CT)
      scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aetiology is unknown.
