- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, acquired, dermis elastic tissue disease characterized by asymptomatic,
      well-demarcated, symmetric patches and/or plaques of finely wrinkled skin arranged
      parallel to skin cleavage lines (type I), associated with perifollicular papular
      protrusions (type II) or with persistent reticular erythema (type III), occurring
      predominantly on the shoulders, trunk, back, and proximal extremities, associating,
      on histopathology, a selective loss of elastic tissue in the midreticular dermis.
      Erythema and/or urticaria may or may not precede wrinkly lesions.
