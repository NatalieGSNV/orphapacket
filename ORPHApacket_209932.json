Night blindness usually develops later in the course of the disease, but it can also be apparent from childhood. A hallmark of CDSRR is the decreased and delayed dark-adapted response to dim flashes in electroretinographic recordings, which contrasts with the supernormal b-wave response at the highest levels of stimulation."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"610356","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"3","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Cone dystrophy with supernormal rod ERG"},{"lang":"en","label":"Cone dystrophy with supernormal rod electroretinogram"},{"lang":"en","label":"Cone dystrophy with supernormal scotopic electroretinogram"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"potassium voltage-gated channel modifier subfamily V member 2"}],"Symbol":"KCNV2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"19698"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"607604"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
