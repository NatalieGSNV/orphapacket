- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, acquired human prion disease characterized by rapidly progressive
      neurodegeneration, cerebellar symptoms (especially ataxia, but also tremor,
      dysarthria, and nystagmus) being the most prominent clinical feature, following
      an asymptomatic incubation period of up to several decades and a non-specific
      prodromal phase with headaches and arthralgia. Other neurological signs occurring
      in the course of the disease involve also the brain stem, mid-brain, hypothalamus,
      and cerebral cortex. Emotional changes include inappropriate euphoria and compulsive
      laughter, or depression and apprehension. The disease is invariably fatal within
      approximately one year.
