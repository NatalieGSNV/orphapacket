  - Contents: A rare odontogenic tumor characterized by aggressive clinical course
      and local destruction, occurring in mandible more often than in maxilla. The
      most common symptom is a rapidly progressing painful swelling, but it may present
      as a benign cystic lesion or as a large, rapidly growing mass with ulceration,
      bone resorption and teeth mobility, as well. The tumor may metastasize, most
      commonly to the cervical lymph nodes and the lungs.
