Additonal manifestations include ocular and dental anomalies (e.g. corneal opacity, hyperopia, optic atrophy, tortuous retinal vessels, dental caries, enamel defects) and, occasionally, hypoplastic nails and neonatal liver disease. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive, with more severe growth retardation, small hands and feet, intellectual disability, microcephaly and recurrent bacterial infections being observed in the latter."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"244460","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"127000","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Kenny syndrome"}]}]}]}
