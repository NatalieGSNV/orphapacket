Most patients cannot walk long distances, and many have decreased joint spaces, as well as sclerotic and cystic changes on imaging."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"613343","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"3","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}]}]}
