Progressive sensorineural deafness, intellectual disability and absent speech are also associated. Laboratory tests demonstrate 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and temporary elevated serum lactate and transaminases."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614739","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"3-methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness-encephalopathy-Leigh-like syndrome"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"serine active site containing 1"}],"Symbol":"SERAC1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"21061"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614725"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
