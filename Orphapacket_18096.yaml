- TextSection:
  - Contents: Complete septate uterus is a rare, non-syndromic uterovaginal malformation
      characterized by a uterus that has a longitudinal septum which elongates from
      the uterine fundus to the internal or external cervical os. Most often women
      are asymptomatic, however dysmenorrhea, unilateral obstruction, and endometriosis
      could be observed. Unlike urinary tract abnormalities, which are very rarely
      associated, poor reproductive outcome is frequent.
