- TextSection:
  - Contents: Right superior vena cava connecting to the left-sided atrium is a rare,
      congenital vascular malformation of the major vessels characterized by the right
      SVC passing medially and dorsally to the aortic root and draining into the left
      atrium. Patients usually present a right-to-left systemic venous blood shunt
      which may manifest with arterial hypoxemia, cyanosis, exercise dyspnea, clubbing
      of the fingers, palpitations, murmurs and/or potentially fatal brain abscess.
      Association with other cardiac anomalies has been reported.
