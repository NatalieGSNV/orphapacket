If untreated (by surgical removal) complications include restriction of neck extension due to contracture and scarring. It is sometimes associated with other developmental defects such as bifid mandible, thyroglossal duct and branchial cysts, and microgenia."}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
