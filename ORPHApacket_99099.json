The upper chamber receives blood from the pulmonary veins, the lower chamber is attached to the left atrial appendage blocking the mitral valve orifice and leading to obstruction of the left ventricular inflow. It may be asymptomatic or present in infancy with tachypnea, dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest pain, syncope, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, or heart failure, depending on the degree of obstruction. The anomaly may be isolated or associated with other congenital heart anomalies."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Cor triatriatum sinistrum"},{"lang":"en","label":"Divided left atrium"}]}]}]}
