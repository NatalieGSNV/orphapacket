- TextSection:
  - Contents: Giant adenofibroma of the breast is a rare, benign, fibroepithelial
      tumor which usually manifests as a unilateral, painless, firm, mobile, slow-growing
      mass in the breast that measures more than 5 cm. It can be associated with significant
      asymmetry and/or deformity of the breast and hormonal changes (e.g. puberty,
      pregnancy, oral contraceptives) can lead to its marked enlargement.
