  - Contents: A rare, congenital anomaly of the great arteries characterized by cranially
      situated aortic arch ascending into the neck above the clavicles. Most patients
      remain asymptomatic, some present with a murmur and a pulsatile neck mass, stridor,
      dyspnea, recurrent bronchitis, dysphagia or signs and symptoms of a stenosis/aneurism
      of the aortic arch. Other congenital heart anomalies are frequently associated,
      including abnormalities of arch laterality and branching, aortic coarctation
      or aneurysm.
