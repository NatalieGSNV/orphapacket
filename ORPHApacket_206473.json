Most patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and the symptoms, if present, are often nonspecific and vague, such as pelvic pain, abdominal mass or, rarely, gastrointestinal problems including early satiety or bloating. Six histological subtypes are currently recognized, based on the epithelial cell type."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Borderline ovarian epithelial tumor"},{"lang":"en","label":"Ovarian tumor of low malignant potential"}]}]}]}
