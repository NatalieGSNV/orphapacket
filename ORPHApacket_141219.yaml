- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngological malformation characterized by the presence
      of a dermoid cyst, located on the dorsum of the nose, which presents a fistula,
      often extending to the intracranial region. Patients present a firm, slow-growing
      mass, which contains skin and dermal elements (including hair follicles and
      sebaceous glands), that do not transilluminate or compress, and may be associated
      with intermittent or chronic discharge of sebaceous material, soft tissue and
      skeletal deformity, and local infection. Meningitis, convulsions and cerebral
      abscess may be observed if intracranial extension exists.
