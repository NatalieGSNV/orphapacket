Additional features include dilated main pulmonary artery (with or without dilatation of pulmonary artery branches), to-and-fro flow at site of the dysplastic pulmonary valve, and systolic pressure gradient across narrowed pulmonary valve. Tricuspid atresia and variable extra-cardiac anomalies (e.g. diaphragmatic hernia or cleft lip\/palate), may be present."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"APV\/PDA, non-Fallot type"}]}]}]}
