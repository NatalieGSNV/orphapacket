- TextSection:
  - Contents: Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a rare systemic fibrosing condition
      observed in renally impaired patients and characterized by a hardening and thickening
      of the skin with fibrotic plaques or papules, pruritus, joint pain and stiffness,
      muscle weakness, limitation of range of motion, and yellowed eyes. It is generally
      associated with administration of gadolinium-based magnetic resonance imaging
      contrast agents (GBCA) in patients with kidney disease.
