- TextSection:
  - Contents: Severe lateral tibial bowing with short stature is a rare, genetic,
      primary bent bone dysplasia characterized by significant, uni-/bilateral, lateral
      tibial bowing localized to the distal two-thirds of the tibia, with respective
      cortical thickening and thinning of the inner and outer tibial curve, loss of
      normal trabecular bone, bilateral abnormalities of the tibial epiphyses and
      growth plates, as well as foot abnormalities, including abnormally high arches.
      Affected individuals have short stature with absence of other skeletal abnormalities.
