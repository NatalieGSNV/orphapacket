Patients present audiological (autophony, aural fullness, conductive hearing loss, pulsatile tinnitus) and\/or vestibular symptoms (sound or pressure-evoked oscillopsia or vertigo, characteristic vertical-torsional eye movements), depending on which semicircular canal is affected. Posterior SCD syndrome is associated with high-riding jugular bulb and fibrous dysplasia, while lateral SCD syndrome is associated with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma, with or without audiological and vestibular symptoms."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"SCD syndrome"}]}]}]}
