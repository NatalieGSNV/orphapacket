Neurological manifestations may also be associated, such as abnormal eye movements, blurred vision, agitation and restlessness, as well as muscle fasciculations and spasms. Signs and symptoms are highly variable and in most severe cases may lead to cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
