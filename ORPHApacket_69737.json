The syndrome is caused by homozygous mutations in the <i>HOXA1<\/i> gene (7p15.2) and is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner. The syndrome overlaps clinically and genetically with Athabaskan brain dysfunction syndrome (ABDS,). However unlike ABDS, BSAS does not manifest central hypoventilation."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"601536","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21534","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"NTBT (narrower term maps to a broader term)"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}]}]}
