- TextSection:
  - Contents: Leiomyosarcoma of the cervix uteri is a rare, malignant mesenchymal
      tumor of smooth muscle origin, macroscopically appearing as a large, poorly
      circumscribed mass, often protruding from the cervical canal or expanding it
      circumferentially. The most common presenting symptoms are vaginal discharge
      or bleeding, pain in the lower abdomen and a bulky cervical mass. There is a
      reported tendency to metastatsize hematogenously, especially to the lungs, peritoneum,
      bones and the liver.
