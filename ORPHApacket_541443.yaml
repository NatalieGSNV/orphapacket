- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous
      origin and course of the left coronary artery, which originates from the right
      aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course, which may be intramural,
      prepulmonic, subpulmonic, retroaortic, retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex.
      Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations,
      dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest/death at any age (typically following
      intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated
      with a high risk of sudden cardiac death so surgical revascularization is recommended
      even in cases with no associated evidence of myocardial ischemia.
