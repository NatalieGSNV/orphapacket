- TextSection:
  - Contents: Familial Renal Glucosuria (FRG) is characterized by the presence of
      persistent isolated glucosuria in the absence of both generalized proximal tubular
      dysfunction and hyperglycemia. FRG is usually considered a benign entity as
      most patients are not affected by severe clinical consequences. Polyuria and
      enuresis and later a mild growth and pubertal maturation delay are the only
      manifestations that have been reported during a follow-up period of 30 years.
      Episodic dehydration and ketosis during pregnancy and starvation and an increased
      incidence of urinary tract infections have occasionally been reported in severe
      cases. FRG is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene <i>SLC5A2</i>
      (16p11.2).
