- TextSection:
  - Contents: Familial congenital palsy of trochlear nerve is a rare, genetic, neuro-ophthalmological
      disease characterized by congenital fourth cranial nerve palsy, manifesting
      with hypertropia in side gaze, unexplained head tilt, acquired vertical diplopia,
      and progressive increase in vertical fusional vergence amplitudes with prolonged
      occlusion. Facial asymmetry (i.e. hemifacial retrusion, upward slanting of mouth
      on the side of the head tilt, mild enophthalmos of paretic eye) and superior
      oblique tendon abnormalities (such as absence, redundance, misdirection) are
      frequently associated. Some asymptomatic cases have been reported.
