  - Contents: Kandori fleck retina is a rare, genetic retinal dystrophy disorder characterized
      by irregular, sharply defined, yellowish-white lesions of variable size that
      are distributed mainly in the nasal equatorial region of the retina, with a
      tendency to confluence, that are not associated with any vascular or optic nerve
      abnormalities. They frequently manifest as mild and stationary night blindness.
