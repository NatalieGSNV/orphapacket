- TextSection:
  - Contents: Microtia is a congenital malformation of the external ear, seen more
      frequently in males, that occurs sporadically or is inherited, that is characterized
      by unilateral (79-93% of cases, 60% of which involve the right ear) or bilateral
      small and abnormally shaped auricles and that is often associated with atresia
      or stenosis of the ear canal, attention deficit disorders and delayed language
      development. The variation in auricle size ranges from grade I, where the auricle
      is simply smaller than normal, to grade IV, also known as anotia (see this term),
      where there is a complete absence of the external ear and of the auditory canal.
