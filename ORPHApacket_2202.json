A patchy distribution is observed with accentuation on the thenars, hypothenars and the arches of the feet. The disease becomes apparent in infancy and is associated with sensorineural hearing loss that shows a variable age of onset. Due to genetic and clinical similarities, it has been proposed that palmoplantar keratoderma-deafness syndrome, knuckle pads-leukonychia-sensorineural deafness-palmoplantar hyperkeratosis syndrome and keratoderma hereditarium mutilans may represent variants of one broad disorder of syndromic deafness with heterogeneous phenotype. The disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"148350","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Mitochondrial inheritance"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"4","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"PPK-deafness syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis-deafness syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis-hearing loss syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Palmoplantar keratoderma-hearing loss syndrome"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"2","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"gap junction protein beta 2"}],"Symbol":"GJB2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"4284"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"121011"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"mitochondrially encoded tRNA-Ser (UCN) 1"}],"Symbol":"MT-TS1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"7497"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"590080"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"3","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000407","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000407","HPOTerm":"Sensorineural hearing impairment","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000962","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000962","HPOTerm":"Hyperkeratosis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000982","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000982","HPOTerm":"Palmoplantar keratoderma","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
