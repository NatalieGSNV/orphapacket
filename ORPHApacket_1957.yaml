- TextSection:
  - Contents: Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the sinonasal
      cavity, arising from the basal layers of olfactory neuroepithelial cells in
      the superior nasal vault, which usually occurs in the 5th to 6th decades of
      life and is characterized clinically by non-specific symptoms such as progressive
      ipsilateral nasal block, sinusitis, facial pain, intermittent headaches, hyposmia/dysosmia,
      rhinorrhea and epistaxis as well as proptosis, diplopia and excessive lacrimation
      due to orbital extension. With early treatment and in the absence of distant
      metastases, ENB appears to have a good prognosis (compared to other superior
      nasal malignancies), despite a high rate of cervical metastases.
