Isolated parachute tricuspid valve may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms of tricuspid stenosis (diastolic inspiratory murmur, pulsation of jugular veins, hepatomegaly, edema, epigastric discomfort, right atrial enlargement, right ventricular hypertrophy, electrocardiography abnormalities). It may also be associated with other heart malformations and present with symptoms of the complex of malformations."}]}]}
