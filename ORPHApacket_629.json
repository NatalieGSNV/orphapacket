Prevalence is unknown but only a few cases have been reported in the literature. The syndrome is caused by various mutations in the <i>GH1<\/i> gene (17q22-q24) that result in structural GH anomalies and a biologically inactive molecule. Transmission is autosomal recessive."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"262650","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Kowarski syndrome"}]}]}]}
