  - Contents: A rare, primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by solitary
      cutaneous nodule or only regional disease, typically occurring on the head and
      neck, and involving entire dermis. Sometimes, subcutis and adnexal structures
      are involved, as well. The infiltrate is nodular or diffuse, composed of small
      to medium sized pleomorphic lymphocytes and showing mild to moderate cytologic
      atypia. Neoplastic T-cells are mixed with B-cells, histiocytes, plasma cells
      and eosinophils.
