- TextSection:
  - Contents: Paraquat poisoning is a rare intoxication with paraquat (a non-selective
      bipyridilium herbicide that has been banned in Europe), usually occurring through
      ingestion of the poison, and that presents with caustic injury of the oral cavity
      and pharynx, as well as nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, lethargy, loss of
      consciousness and fever. Patients may develop potentially life-threatening complications
      such as hepatic dysfunction, acute tubular necrosis and renal insufficiency,
      and respiratory failure (due to pulmonary fibrosis) due to its inherent toxicity
      and lack of effective treatment. Intoxication via inhalation, injection and
      dermal or mucus contact have also been reported.
