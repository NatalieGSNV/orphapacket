  - Contents: Marfanoid syndrome, da Silva type is characterized by the association
      of marfanoid habitus with visceral diverticula. It has been reported in four
      adults and two siblings from a consanguineous marriage in two different publications.
      Pediatric cases also presented with diaphragmatic hernia. Other connective tissue
      disorders with visceral diverticula have been reported previously, suggesting
      a relationship between these two conditions.
