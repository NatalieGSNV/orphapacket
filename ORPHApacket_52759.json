Vasculitis occurs at any age, may be acute or chronic, and manifests with general symptoms such as fever, weight loss and fatigue, as well as more specific clinical signs depending on the type of vessels and organs affected. The degree of severity is variable, ranging from life or sight threatening disease (e.g. Beh\u00c3\u00a7et disease, see this term) to relatively minor skin disease."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Systemic vasculitis"}]}]}]}
