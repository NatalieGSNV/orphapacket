The bands have a lifelong duration, may only be detectable under light microscopy, are more apparent in fair-colored hair or with age-related graying, and have no effect on hair growth or fragility in the vast majority of cases."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"180600","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Pili annulati"}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"2","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0002213","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002213","HPOTerm":"Fine hair","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0010720","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0010720","HPOTerm":"Abnormal hair pattern","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
