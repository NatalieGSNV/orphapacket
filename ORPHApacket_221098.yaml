- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare cranial neuralgia characterized by paroxysmal, usually unilateral
      stabbing pain within the sensory distributions of the auricular and pharyngeal
      branches of the glossopharyngeal and the vagus nerve (i. e. the posterior part
      of the tongue, the tonsillar fossa, oropharynx, larynx, angle of the mandible,
      and/or ear). The attacks last seconds to minutes with intervals between the
      paroxysms ranging from a few minutes to a few hours, and appear in clusters
      lasting weeks to months, again with irregular intervals in between. Pain attacks
      are usually triggered by a specific stimulus but may also occur spontaneously.
      The condition can sometimes be associated with bradycardia, syncope, seizures,
      and even asystole, and is then termed vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia.
