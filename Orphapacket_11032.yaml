  - Contents: 'Intractable diarrhoea of infancy (IDI) is a heterogeneous syndrome
      that includes several diseases with different aetiologies. Provisional classification
      of IDI, according to villous atrophy and based on immunohistological criteria,
      distinguishes two clearly different groups of IDI: 1) Immune-mediated: characterised
      by a mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria and considered as being
      related to T cell activation. 2) The second histological pattern includes early
      onset severe intractable diarrhoea histologically characterised by villous atrophy
      with low or without mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria but
      specific histological abnormalities involving the epithelium.'
