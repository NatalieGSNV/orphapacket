Onset is usually in the fourth decade of life and the course lasts about 20 years. Reported clinical manifestations include diarrhea, nausea, autonomic failure (areflexia, weakness), neurogenic bladder and urinary infections. The disorder is caused by truncation mutations of the prion protein gene <i>PRNP<\/i> (20p13) leading to deposition of prion protein amyloid."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Chronic diarrhea with HSAN"},{"lang":"en","label":"Chronic diarrhea with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy"},{"lang":"en","label":"Prion protein systemic amyloidosis"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"prion protein"}],"Symbol":"PRNP","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"9449"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"176640"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
