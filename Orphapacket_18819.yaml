- TextSection:
  - Contents: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) poisoning is a rare intoxication caused by the
      prolonged, low-dose administration of 5-FU, which is the mainstay of both adjuvant
      and advanced-disease chemotherapy regimens in colon cancer. 5-FU poisoning is
      characterized by gastrointestinal (nausea, emesis, diarrhea, anorexia, stomatitis)
      and hematologic (myelosuppression) toxicities as well as mucositis, alopecia
      and, occasionally, palmar-plantar dysesthesia (more commonly known as hand-foot
      syndrome). Women have been reported to experience more 5-FU-related toxicity
      than men.
