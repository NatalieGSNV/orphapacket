  - Contents: Malposition of the coronary ostium is a rare coronary artery congenital
      malformation characterized by displacement of one of the coronary arteries,
      originating closer to the aortic root or to the commissural area. The anomaly
      is considered to be asymptomatic, however, it may impose surgical difficulties
      during aortic root surgery.
