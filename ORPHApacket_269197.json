It may be an incidental finding or may present at different ages with clinical features depending on its size and location. It may distort adjacent brain structures and cause macrocephaly, ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, focal neurological signs and other signs and symptoms. In some cases, it is associated with other cerebral malformations (e.g. corpus callosum agenesis, polymicrogyria, heterotopias)."}]}]}
