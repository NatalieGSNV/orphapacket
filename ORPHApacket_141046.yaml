- TextSection:
  - Contents: Cervical dermoid cyst is a rare, benign cutaneous neoplasm containing
      keratinized epithelium and dermal derivatives, such as hair follicles, sweat
      and sebaceous glands, smooth muscle or fibroadipose tissue which usually manifests
      as a slow-growing, painless mass in the submandibular or sublingual space. Depending
      on the location, and especially after sudden enlargement, it can cause dyspnea,
      dysphagia or dysphonia.
