- TextSection:
  - Contents: Amyloidosis cutis dyschromia is a rare primary cutaneous amyloidosis
      characterized by macular or reticulate hyperpigmentation with symmetrically
      distributed guttate hypo- and hyperpigmented lesions which progress gradually
      over the years to involve almost the entire body (with relative sparing of the
      face, hands, feet and neck). Patients are usually asymptomatic, however mild
      pruritus may be associated. Amyloid deposition in the papillary dermis is observed
      on skin biopsy. Systemic amyloidosis is not present and association with generalized
      morphea, atypical Parkinsonism, spasticity, motor weakness or colon carcinoma
      is rare.
