It has been described in several patients. Clinical findings include progressive neurological impairment, hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive and metabolic acidosis. Some patients had hyperglycinemia secondary to the organic acidemia. However, some of the reported patients were asymptomatic. D-glyceric aciduria is caused by D-glycerate kinase deficiency.
