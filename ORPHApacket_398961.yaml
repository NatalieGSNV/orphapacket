  - Contents: Mucinous adenocarcinoma of ovary is a rare, malignant epithelial tumor
      of the ovary characterized, macroscopically, by a large, usually unilateral
      tumor with smooth surface and evenly distributed cystic and solid areas and,
      histologically, by a complex papillary growth pattern with microscopic cystic
      glands and necrotic debris. Patients often present with pelvic pain and pressure,
      abdominal mass or gastrointestinal problems such as early satiety or bloating.
