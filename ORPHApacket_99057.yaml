- TextSection:
  - Contents: Congenital mitral stenosis is a congenital heart malformation comprising
      a spectrum of morphologically heterogeneous developmental anomalies that result
      in functional and anatomic obstruction of inflow into the left ventricle. The
      structure of the mitral valve is affected at the level of the supravalvular
      ring, annulus, leaflets or subvalvar copmponents and include supra-valvular
      ring, leaflet fusion (intra-leaflet ring), mitral parachute deformity and papillary
      muscle abnormalities. It may be isolated or associated with other heart malformations.
      The clinical presentation depends on the degree of obstruction, the presence
      of regurgitation, the presence and severity of associated pulmonary hypertension,
      and the presence of associated heart malformations. It may present with symptoms
      and signs of low cardiac output and right ventricular failure such as pulmonary
      infections, failure to thrive, exertional dyspnoea, cough, cyanosis and congestive
      heart failure.
