- TextSection:
  - Contents: Mononen-Karnes-Senac syndrome is characterized by skeletal dysplasia
      associated with finger malformations (brachydactyly with short and abducted
      thumbs, short index fingers, and markedly short and abducted great toes), variable
      mild short stature, and mild bowleg with overgrowth of the fibula. It has been
      described in two males, their mothers, and a maternal aunt. Females are less
      severely affected than males. X-linked dominant inheritance is suggested.
