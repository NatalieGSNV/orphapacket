It has been described in three members of the same family and in one unrelated boy. Associated features in the familial cases include retinal anomalies, spina bifida, kyphoscoliosis and hallux valgus, while that in the non-familial case includes developmental delay. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is suggested. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1993."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"239840","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"6","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0001305","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001305","HPOTerm":"Dandy-Walker malformation","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002230","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002230","HPOTerm":"Generalized hirsutism","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0003457","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0003457","HPOTerm":"EMG abnormality","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002754","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002754","HPOTerm":"Osteomyelitis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0040165","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0040165","HPOTerm":"Periostitis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0200042","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0200042","HPOTerm":"Skin ulcer","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
