- TextSection:
  - Contents: Adenosarcoma of the cervix uteri is a rare subtype of malignant mixed
      epithelial and mesenchymal tumor composed of benign or mildly atypical glandular
      elements and a surrounding low-grade malignant stroma, often containing heterologous
      elements, such as areas of sex-cord-like or smooth muscle differentiation. It
      usually presents with vaginal bleeding or discharge, lower abdominal pain and/or
      a cervical mass or polyp. The tumor may arise from pre-existing endometriosis
      and patients may have a history of recurrent cervical polyps.
