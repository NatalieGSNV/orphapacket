Bilateral macular cherry red spots are also present. Sialidosis type II has been further divided into congenital (with hydrops fetalis), infantile and juvenile presentations."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}]}]}
