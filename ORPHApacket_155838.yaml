- TextSection:
  - Contents: Pinnae fistula or cyst is a rare otorhinolaryngological malformation
      characterized by the presence of a, usually unilateral, sinus tract or cyst
      located in the vicinity of the auricle (most frequently identified by a small
      pit near the anterior margin of the first ascending portion of the helix). Typically,
      patients are asymptomatic and usually only present symptoms (pain, erythema,
      discharge from pit) in relation to infection. Renal and inner ear anomalies
      may be associated.
