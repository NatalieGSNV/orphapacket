In the one patient described haploinsufficiency of the human riboflavin transporter (hRFT1) was described in the mother."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"4","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Transient neonatal MAD deficiency"},{"lang":"en","label":"Transient neonatal MADD"},{"lang":"en","label":"Transient neonatal glutaric acidemia type 2"},{"lang":"en","label":"Transient neonatal glutaric aciduria type 2"}]}]}]}
