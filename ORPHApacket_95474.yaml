  - Contents: A rare, congenital, non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by
      a single fibrous annulus with two orifices opening into the left ventricle.
      Clinical presentation is variable and related to the degree of resulting mitral
      insufficiency and/or stenosis, and depending on the associated heart disease,
      most commonly atrioventricular septal defect, obstructive left-sided lesions,
      and cyanotic heart disease. Rare cases of isolated disease have been reported.
