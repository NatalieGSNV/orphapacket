- TextSection:
  - Contents: Stapes fixation (stapedovestibular ankylosis) is a hearing loss condition
      that appears as a consequence of annular ligament destruction followed by excessive
      connective tissue production during the healing process. This condition is mainly
      observed in otosclerosis, but is also found in chronic otitis media with tympanosclerosis,
      and other rare bone diseases such as Paget's disease and osteogenesis imperfecta
      (Lobstein disease).
