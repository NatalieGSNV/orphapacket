Additional manifestations include variable auto-inflammatory symptoms such as uveitis, arthritis, skin abscesses, erythema nodosum, and nephritis. Neurological involvement is rare and lymphoma is never observed. Laboratory findings include normal or increased activated T cells, low or normal iNKT cells, and normal or reduced memory B cells."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"300635","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"4","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"X-linked recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 2"},{"lang":"en","label":"XIAP deficiency syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"XLP2"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis"}],"Symbol":"XIAP","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"592"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"300079"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
