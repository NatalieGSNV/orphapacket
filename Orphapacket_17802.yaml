- TextSection:
  - Contents: Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm associated with PDGFRA rearrangement is a
      rare, malignant, neoplastic disease characterized by clonal proliferation of
      myeloid and/or lymphoid precursors harboring rearrangements in the PDGFRA gene,
      in the blood, bone marrow and often other tissues as well (spleen, lymph nodes,
      skin, etc.). It usually presents as chronic eosinophilic leukemia or, less commonly,
      as acute myeloid leukemia or T-lymphoblastic leukemia with eosinophilia. Patients
      usually present with eosinophilia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, splenomegaly,
      lymphadenopathy, fever, sweating and/or weight loss. Tissue infiltration by
      eosinophils can manifest with skin rash, erythema, cough, neurological alterations,
      gastrointestinal symptoms or, rarely, endomyocardial fibrosis and restrictive
      cardiomyopathy.
