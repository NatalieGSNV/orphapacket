- TextSection:
  - Contents: MITF-related melanoma and renal cell carcinoma predisposition syndrome
      is an inherited cancer-predisposing syndrome due to a gain-of-function germline
      mutation in the MITF gene, associated with a higher incidence of amelanotic
      and nodular melanoma, multiple primary melanomas and increase in nevus number
      and size. It may also predispose to co-occurring melanoma and renal cell carcinoma
      and to pancreatic cancer.
