  - Contents: Chapare hemorrhagic fever, caused by the Chapare virus (a new arenavirus),
      discovered from a small outbreak in Cochabamba, Bolivia between 2003 and 2004,
      is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia,
      and multiple hemorrhagic signs. About a third of untreated cases go on to develop
      more severe symptoms with delirium, coma and convulsions and death (in one case).
      No other cases have been reported since.
