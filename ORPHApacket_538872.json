Histologically, the lesion presents a central layer containing neutrophilic inflamation, surrounded by a palisade of histiocytes, which are rimmed by a lymphocytic infiltrate. In comparison with the other variants of pyoderma gangrenosum, this subtype usually shows a good response to less aggressive treatments and underlying systemic disorders are less frequently associated. It is considered the most benign and uncommon clinical variant of pyoderma gangrenosum."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"4","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Elderly"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Granulomatous pyoderma gangrenosum"}]}]}]}
