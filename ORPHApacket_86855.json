There are two separate entities: primary plasmacytoma of the bone and extramedullary plasmacytoma of the soft tissues. Of the extramedullary plasmacytomas, 80% occur in the head and neck, usually in the upper respiratory tract. The median age at diagnosis is 50 years and the male to female ratio is 3:1. Long-term survival is possible following local radiotherapy, particularly for soft tissue presentations."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Solitary plasmacytoma"}]}],"HasSubtypeList":[{"Subtype":[{"Disorder":[{"ORPHA":"100021","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Primary plasmacytoma of the bone"}],"PURL":"http:\/\/www.orpha.net\/ORDO\/Orphanet_100021"}]},{"Disorder":[{"ORPHA":"100022","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Extramedullary soft tissue plasmacytoma"}],"PURL":"http:\/\/www.orpha.net\/ORDO\/Orphanet_100022"}]}]}]}]}
