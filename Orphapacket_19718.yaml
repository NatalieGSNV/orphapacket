- TextSection:
  - Contents: Primary melanoma of the central nervous system is a rare tumor of meninges
      arising from leptomeningeal melanocytes, typically in the perimedullary or high
      cervical region, in the absence of melanoma outside the CNS. The tumor is typically
      a darkly pigmented, solid mass, often containing hemorrhagic or necrotic areas,
      composed of sheets of pleomorphic cells with prominent nucleoli, with frequent
      mitotic figures and parenchymal invasion. Intracranial tumor may present with
      signs of raised intracranial pressure, focal neurological symptoms related to
      tumor location, seizures or subarachnoid hemorrhage, spinal tumor may present
      with back pain, muscle weakness, numbness, plegia or urinary incontinence.
