      cerebral calcifications syndrome is characterized by progressive hyalinosis
      involving capillaries and often arterioles and small veins of the digestive
      tract, kidneys, and idiopathic cerebral calcifications. It has been described
      in three sisters born to non-consanguineous parents. All three patients also
      had poikilodermia and greying hair, as well as severe diarrhoea, rectal bleeding,
      malabsorption and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
