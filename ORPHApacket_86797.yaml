- TextSection:
  - Contents: Atypical lichen myxedematosus is an intermediate form of lichen myxedematosus
      (LM) (a form of mucin dermal deposit) which does not meet the criteria for either
      scleromyxedema or the localized form (see these terms). Three clinical subtypes
      have been described and include scleromyxedema without monoclonal gammopathy;
      localized forms with monoclonal gammopathy and/or systemic symptoms; localized
      forms with mixed features of the 5 subtypes of localized LM (discrete form,
      acral persistent papular mucinosis, self-healing papular mucinosis, papular
      mucinosis of infancy, and a pure nodular form) (see these terms). The course
      of atypical LM is unpredictable because only a few cases have been reported.
