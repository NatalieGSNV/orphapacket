- TextSection:
  - Contents: An intermediate form of lichen myxedematosus (LM) (a form of mucin dermal
      deposit) which does not meet the criteria for either scleromyxedema or the localized
      form. Three clinical subtypes have been described and include scleromyxedema
      without monoclonal gammopathy; localized forms with monoclonal gammopathy and/or
      systemic symptoms; localized forms with mixed features of the 5 subtypes of
      localized LM (discrete form, acral persistent papular mucinosis, self-healing
      papular mucinosis, papular mucinosis of infancy, and a pure nodular form). The
      course of atypical LM is unpredictable because only a few cases have been reported.
