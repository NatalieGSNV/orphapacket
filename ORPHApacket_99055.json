Resulting tethering of one or more tricuspid leaflets leads to their impaired mobility and tricuspid regurgitation. Association with other congenital cardiac anomalies has been reported."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Congenital anomaly of tricuspid chordae tendineae"},{"lang":"en","label":"Congenital anomaly of tricuspid tendinous chords"}]}]}]}
