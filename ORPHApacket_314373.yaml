  - Contents: A rare, genetic, intestinal disease characterized by early-onset, chronic
      diarrhea and intestinal inflammation due to overactivity of guanylate cyclase
      2C. Additional manifestations include meteorism, dehydration, metabolic acidosis
      and electrolyte disturbances. Intestinal dysmotility, small-bowel obstruction
      and esophagitis (with or without esophageal hernia), as well as irritable bowel
      syndrome (without severe abdominal pain) and Crohn's disease, are frequently
      associated.
