The disorder is a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries. Six subtypes have been described in the literature: lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, loiasis, mansonelliasis, dirofilariasis and dracunculiasis caused by <i>Wuchereria bancrofti<\/i> and filarioidea of the genus <i>Brugia<\/i>; <i>Onchocerca volvulus<\/i>; <i>Loa loa<\/i>; <i>Mansonella<\/i>; <i>Dirofilaria<\/i>; and <i>Dracunculus medinensis<\/i>, respectively.
