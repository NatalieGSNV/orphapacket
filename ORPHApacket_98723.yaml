- TextSection:
  - Contents: 'Hypoplastic right-heart syndrome (HRHS) is a rare, cyanotic congenital
      heart malformation (see this term) caused by underdevelopment of the right-sided
      heart structures (tricuspid valve, RV, pulmonary valve, and pulmonary artery)
      commonly associated with an atrial septal defect, ostium secundum type (see
      this term). Pulmonary blood flow is diminished and right-to-left shunting occurs
      at the atrial level, leading to dyspnea, fatigue, atrial arrhythmias, right-sided
      heart failure, hypoxemia, repeated miscarriages that were mostly due to hypoxemia
      and cyanosis. Two subtypes of HRHS have been characterized: pulmonary atresia-intact
      ventricular septum and right ventricular hypoplasia (see these terms).'
