Seizures are typically focal (with prominent eye blinking, facial and limb jerking), precipitated by fever and often commence with an oral sensory aura (anesthetized tongue sensation). When not properly controlled by anti-epileptic medication, weekly frequency and persistance into adult life is observed."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Focal epilepsy-intellectual disability-dysarthria-ataxia syndrome"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"TBC1 domain family member 24"}],"Symbol":"TBC1D24","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"29203"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"613577"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
