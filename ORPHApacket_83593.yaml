  - Contents: Western equine encephalitis (WEE) is an acute arboviral infection caused
      by an <i>alphavirus</i> of the <i>Togaviridae</i> family transmitted by an infected
      mosquito, that more frequently affects children and that is characterized by
      the presence of mild flulike symptoms (fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting,
      and anorexia) but that can progress to weakness, altered mental status, photophobia,
      mental confusion, seizures, somnolence, coma and/or even death. The disease
      can leave neurological sequelae, mainly in infants and children, such as seizures,
      spasticity or behavioral disorders.
