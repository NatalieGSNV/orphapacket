- TextSection:
  - Contents: Staphylococcal necrotizing pneumonia is a rare, bacterial, pulmonary
      infectious disease, caused by a Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus
      aureus strain, characterized by severe respiratory failure, extensive, rapidly
      progressing pneumonia and hemorrhagic lung necrosis. Patients typically present
      with influenza-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, and chest pain, as well
      as hemoptysis, hypotension, leukopenia, and severe respiratory symptoms that
      rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. High
      mortality is associated.
