  - Contents: Marfanoid habitus-inguinal hernia-advanced bone age syndrome is a very
      rare developmental defect with connective tissue involvement disorder characterized
      by tall stature, inguinal hernia, facial dysmorphism (including a long, triangular
      face, prominent forehead, telecanthus, downslanting palpebral fissures, bilateral
      ptosis, everted lower eyelids, large ears, long nose, full, everted vermilions,
      narrow and high arched palate, dental crowding), and radiologic evidence of
