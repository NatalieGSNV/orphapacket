  - Contents: Female restricted epilepsy with intellectual disability is a rare X-linked
      epilepsy syndrome characterized by febrile or afebrile seizures (mainly tonic-clonic,
      but also absence, myoclonic, and atonic) starting in the first years of life
      and, in most cases, developmental delay and intellectual disability of variable
      severity. Behavioral disturbances (e.g. autistic features, hyperactivity, and
      aggressiveness) are also frequently associated. This disease affects exclusively
      females, with male carriers being unaffected, despite an X-linked inheritance.
