Histologically, these are dermis infiltrates consisting of small, marginal zone B cells, lymphoplasmacytic cells, and plasma cells. Marginal zone B cells express CD20, CD79a and Bcl-2, and are negative for CD5, CD10 and Bcl-6. Plasma cells are typically located at the periphery, and express CD138, CD79a, and monotypic light chains."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"PCMZL"}]}]}]}
