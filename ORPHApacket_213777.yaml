  - Contents: High-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix uteri is a rare, aggressive,
      primary cervical neoplasm, originating from neuroendocrine cells present in
      the lining epithelium of the cervix, characterized, macroscopically, by usually
      large lesions, sometimes with a barrel-shaped appearance. Patients often present
      with abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge, pelvic/abdominal pain, post-coital
      spotting and/or dysuria, while symptoms related to carcinoid syndrome are not
      frequent.
