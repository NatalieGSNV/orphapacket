The thumb appearance can differ widely in shape (wedge to rectangular) or it can be deviated in the radio-ulnar plane (clinodactyly). PPD2 is also associated with systemic syndromes, including Holt-Oram syndrome and Fanconi anemia (see these terms)."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"174500","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21534","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"NTBT (narrower term maps to a broader term)"}]}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"PPD2"},{"lang":"en","label":"Preaxial polydactyly type 2"}]}]}]}
