- TextSection:
  - Contents: Nevus of Ito is a benign dermal melanocytosis occurring most frequently
      in the Asian populations and characterized by unilateral, asymptomatic, blue,
      gray or brown skin pigmentation within the acromioclavicular and upper chest
      area (involving the side of the neck, the supraclavicular and scapular areas,
      and the shoulder region). It is usually diagnosed in early infancy and in early
      adolescence. Nevus of Ito may progressively enlarge and darken in color (particularly
      with puberty) and its appearance usually remains stable once adulthood is reached.
      Spontaneous regression does not occur. Malignant melanoma has rarely been reported
      within a nevus of Ito. It shares the clinical features of nevus of Ota, except
      its anatomic location and in rare occasions, mayoccur together with the latter.
