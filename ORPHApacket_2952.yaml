      craniostenosis and arthrogryposis (limitation of extension of elbows, flexed
      adducted thumbs, camptodactyly and clubfeet). Additional features include facial
      dysmorphism ('myopathic' stiff face, antimongoloid slanting, external ophthalmoplegia,
      telecanthus, low-set large malrotated ears, open mouth, mierogenia and high
      arched palate). Velopharyngeal insufficiency with difficulties in swallowing,
      increased secretion of the nose and throat, prominent occiput, generalized muscular
      hypotonia with mild cyanosis and no spontaneous movements, seizures, torticollis,
      areflexia, intellectual disability, hypertrichosis of the lower extremities,
      and scleredema (in the first days of life; see this term) are also observed.
      The disease often leads to early death. Transmission is autosomal recessive.
      No new cases have been described since 1983.
