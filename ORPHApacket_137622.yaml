- TextSection:
  - Contents: Intractable diarrhea-choanal atresia-eye anomalies syndrome is characterised
      by the association of intractable diarrhoea of infancy with choanal atresia.
      Short stature, a prominent and broad nasal bridge, micrognathia, single palmar
      creases, chronic corneal inflammation, cytopenia, and abnormal hair texture
      were also reported. So far, the syndrome has been described in three children
      from the same family. The absence of intellectual deficit and immune deficiency
      allow this syndrome to be distinguished from other forms of intractable diarrhoea
      of infancy described previously.
