The most commonly observed cancer types include uveal melanoma, malignant mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, breast cancer and meningioma, with variable age of onset. Common cutaneous manifestations include malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and benign melanocytic BAP1-mutated atypical intradermal tumors (MBAIT) presenting as multiple skin-coloured to reddish-brown dome-shaped to pedunculated, well-circumscribed papules with an average size of 5 mm, histologically predominantly composed of epithelioid melanocytes with abundant amphophilic cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli and large, vesicular nuclei that vary substantially in size and shape."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614327","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Tumor susceptibility linked to germline BAP1 mutations"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BRCA1 associated protein 1"}],"Symbol":"BAP1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"950"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"603089"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
