- TextSection:
  - Contents: Absence of innominate vein is a rare congenital anomaly of the great
      veins characterized by absence of the left brachiocephalic vein (or innominate
      vein), resulting in an anomalous venous vasculature. Patients are usually asymptomatic
      and the anomaly is typically discovered intraoperatively. An association with
      persistence of left superior vena cava, permanent levoatrial cardinal vein or
      anomaly of the inferior vena cava has been reported in some cases.
