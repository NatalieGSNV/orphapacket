  - Contents: Myopathy with hexagonally cross-linked tubular arrays is a rare, congenital,
      non-dystrophic, mild, slowly progressive, proximal myopathy characterized by
      exercise intolerance and post-exercise myalgia without rhabdomyolysis, associated
      with highly organized hexagonally cross-linked tubular arrays in skeletal muscle
      biopsy. Additional features may include muscle atrophy (or diffuse hypotrophy),
      myalgia with or without musclar weakness, paresis of truncal and limb-girdle
      musculature, minimal ptosis, lumbar hyperlordosis, decreased deep tendon reflexes,
      contractures and pes equinovarus.
