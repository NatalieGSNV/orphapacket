- TextSection:
  - Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 4 is a rare mitochondrial
      disorder due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized by
      a neonatal onset of severe metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress, persistent
      lactic acidosis with episodes of metabolic crises, developmental regression,
      microcephaly, abnormal gaze fixation and pursuit, axial hypotonia with limb
      spasticity and reduced spontaneous movements. Neuroimaging studies reveal polymicrogyria,
      white matter abnormalities and multiple cystic brain lesions, including basal
      ganglia, and cerebral atrophy. Decreased activity of complex I and IV have been
      determined in muscle biopsy.
