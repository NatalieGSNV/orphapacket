- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, neoplastic disease characterized by a typically benign, locally
      aggressive, non self-limiting, osteoblastic bone tumor, usually located on the
      spine, proximal humerus and hip (although any bone may be involved), generally
      manifesting with slowly progressive, dull aching pain which is difficult to
      localize and is not relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin.
      Neurologic symptoms, such as cranial nerve palsies, myelopathy, neuralgia, radiculopathy,
      paraparesis or paraplegia, may be associated if the spine is involved. Imaging
      reveals a lytic (or mixed lytic and blastic) lesion with a radiolucent nidus
      (> 2 cm) associated with reactive sclerotic bone.
