- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, acquired, dermis elastic tissue disorder characterized by multiple,
      asymptomatic, firm, well-demarcated, nonfollicular, hypopigmented or skin-colored
      papules, with a diameter of less than 1 cm, distributed symmetrically over trunk
      and/or proximal limbs (rarely, head, neck, shoulders, armpits, thighs), with
      no extracutaneous manifestations. Histopathology typically reveals decreased
      and fragmented elastic fibers, thickened and/or homogenized collagen bundles
      and, in some, a mild, perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis.
