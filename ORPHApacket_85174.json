It has been described in about 10 patients. An autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested. Pseudodiastrophic dysplasia differs from diastrophic dysplasia (see this term) on the basis of clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings. Clubfoot can be treated by surgical therapy, and neonatal contractures and scoliosis can be relieved by physical therapy. Several of the reported patients died in the neonatal period or during infancy."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"264180","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"9","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000272","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000272","HPOTerm":"Malar flattening","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000926","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000926","HPOTerm":"Platyspondyly","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001539","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001539","HPOTerm":"Omphalocele","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001762","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001762","HPOTerm":"Talipes equinovarus","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002564","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002564","HPOTerm":"Malformation of the heart and great vessels","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002650","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002650","HPOTerm":"Scoliosis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0003042","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0003042","HPOTerm":"Elbow dislocation","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0006243","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0006243","HPOTerm":"Phalangeal dislocation","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0008905","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0008905","HPOTerm":"Rhizomelia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
