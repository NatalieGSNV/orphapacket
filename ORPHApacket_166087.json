This anomaly results in spontaneous binding of high molecular weight VWF multimers to platelets leading to rapid clearance of both the platelets (increasing the risk of thrombocytopenia) and the high molecular weight VWF multimers from the plasma."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"613554","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21534","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"NTBT (narrower term maps to a broader term)"}]}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}]}]}
