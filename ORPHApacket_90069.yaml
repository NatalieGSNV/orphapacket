- TextSection:
  - Contents: Systemic monochloroacetate poisoning is a rare, life-threatening intoxication
      with monochloroacetic acid (mainly through the skin, but also by inhalation
      or ingestion). It is characterized by vomiting, diarrhea and central nervous
      system (CNS)-excitability (disorientation, delirium, convulsions) as early signs
      of systemic poisoning, followed by CNS-depression, coma and cerebral edema.
      Additional signs include heart involvement (severe myocardial depression, shock,
      arrhythmias, nonspecific myocardial damage), severe metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia,
      hypocalcemia and progressive renal failure leading to anuria. Myoglobinemia
      and leukocytosis may occur. Manifestations may be delayed for 1-4 hours.
