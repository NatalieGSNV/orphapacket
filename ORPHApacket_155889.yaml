- TextSection:
  - Contents: Coloboma of inferior eyelid is a rare developmental defect during embryogenesis
      characterized by a unilateral or bilateral, partial or full-thickness, variably
      sized defect of the inferior eyelid (ranging from a small notch to complete
      absence of the entire lid) which is usually triangular in shape (with base at
      eyelid margin) and located on the lateral third of the lid. It can occur isolated,
      associated with facial clefting or as part of a syndrome.
