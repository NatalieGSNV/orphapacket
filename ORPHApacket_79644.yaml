- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, congenital, isolated hyperinsulinism disorder characterized
      by neonatal presentation of severe refractory hypoglycemia in the first two
      days of life, with limited response to medical management, sometimes requiring
      pancreatic resection. Newborns are often large for gestational age with mild
      to moderate hepatomegaly and diffuse form of hyperinsulinism due to Kir6.2 deficiency.
      Persistent hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and type1 diabetes mellitus may develop
      later in life. Life-threatening hypoglycemic coma or status epilepticus have
      also been associated.
