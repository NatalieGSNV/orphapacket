      syndrome is a rare junctional epidermolysis bullosa subtype characterized by
      late-onset blistering surrounded by erythema and localized on the anterior aspect
      of the lower legs, associated with dystrophic toenails, tooth enamel defects
      and mild to severe intellectual disability. Lens subluxation and mild facial
      dysmorphism (with short midface, prognatism and thin upper lip vermilion) are
      additional reported features. There have been no further descriptions in the
      literature since 1992.
