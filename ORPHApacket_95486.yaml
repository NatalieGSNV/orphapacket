- TextSection:
  - Contents: Premature closure of the arterial duct is a rare arterial duct anomaly,
      defined as a significant constriction or closure of the fetal arterial duct
      in the absence of structural heart defects with pathognomonic features of increased
      right ventricular afterload, tricuspid regurgitation and, consequently, right
      atrial dilation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The severity of symptoms
      is related to the degree and rate of ductal constriction and ranges from mild
      postnatal respiratory distress to development of ventricular failure with fetal
      hydrops and intrauterine death or severe cardiopulmonary compromise in the postnatal
      period. It may be associated with a prenatal exposure to cyclooxygenase inhibitors
      or corticosteroids.
