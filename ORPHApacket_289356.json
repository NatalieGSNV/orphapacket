It is apparently chemoresistant and has a worse prognosis than gestational choriocarcinoma (see this term) and hence should be distinguished from the latter by DNA polymorphism."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Unknown"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"NGCO"},{"lang":"en","label":"Primary non-gestational ovarian choriocarcinoma"}]}]}]}
