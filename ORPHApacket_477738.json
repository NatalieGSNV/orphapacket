Pediatric MS patients present a predominantly relapsing-remitting course with first attack usually consisting of optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and monofocal or polyfocal neurological deficits. A high burden of T2-hyperintense lesions on intial MRI, primarily of the supratentorial region and\/or of the cervical spinal cord, has been reported."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"2","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1"}],"Symbol":"HLA-DQB1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"4944"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"604305"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"465410","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Biomarker tested in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 1"}],"Symbol":"HLA-DRB1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"4948"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"142857"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"465410","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Biomarker tested in"}]}]}]}]}]}
