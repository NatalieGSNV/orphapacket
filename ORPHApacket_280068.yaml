- TextSection:
  - Contents: Visceral calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening, non-inflammatory
      vasculopathy disorder characterized by diffuse precipitation of calcium in viscera
      (mainly in the heart or lungs, but also in the stomach or kidneys) leading to
      fibrosis and thrombosis, which eventually cause necrotic ulcerations of the
      tissue. Patients may present with dyspnea, cough and respiratory failure or
      acute heart block and subsequent sudden cardiac death, depending on the affected
      organ. The disease mainly affects patients on dialysis or patients having undergone
      renal transplantation.
