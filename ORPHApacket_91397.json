Several cases have been reported. It can occur sporadically or following an autosomal dominant transmission pattern. In some cases, AFA can be associated with other disorders, such as trisomy 18. The bands should be removed to avoid amblyopia and this can easily be performed in the neonatal period by cutting with tissue scissors."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
