Phenotype includes lumbosacral agenesis, anal atresia or ectopia, genitourinary abnormalities, components of VATER or VACTERL association, and facial dysmorphism (flat facies, abnormal ears, bilateral epicanthic folds, depressed nasal bridge, micrognathia). Additional features reported include cardiovascular (e.g. endocardial cushion defect, hypoplasia of pulmonary artery) and skeletal (kyphosis, hemipelvis) anomalies."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Rudd-Klimek syndrome"}]}]}]}
