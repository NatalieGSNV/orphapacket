The disorders all involve accumulation of an abnormal prion protein in the central nervous system with no specific immunological response. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD; see this term) is the most frequent form accounting for about 85% of prion disease cases. The other forms of prion disease are genetic (5-15%) and include inherited CJD, fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and Familial Alzheimer-like prion disease (see these terms). Acquired forms (< 5%) include iatrogenic CJD and variant CJD (vCDJ)."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"TSE"},{"lang":"en","label":"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy"}]}]}]}
