  - Contents: Benign partial epilepsy with secondarily generalized seizures in infancy
      is a rare infantile epilepsy syndrome characterized by seizures presenting with
      motion arrest and staring. They are followed by generalized tonic-clonic convulsions
      with normal interictal EEG and focal paroxysmal discharges, followed by generalization
      in ictal EEG. Seizures usually occur in clusters and are responsive to treatment.
      Psychomotor development is normal.
