Duodenal atresia and absent thymus were also reported. So far, it has been described in four unrelated infants identified through a congenital malformation screening program carried out in Spain. The prevalence was estimated at around 1 in 330,000. The etiology is unknown but it was suggested that the syndrome is caused by defective expression of a developmental control gene."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"7","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0001171","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001171","HPOTerm":"Split hand","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001829","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001829","HPOTerm":"Foot polydactyly","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002247","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002247","HPOTerm":"Duodenal atresia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0003422","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0003422","HPOTerm":"Vertebral segmentation defect","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0004322","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0004322","HPOTerm":"Short stature","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0005359","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0005359","HPOTerm":"Aplasia of the thymus","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0009829","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0009829","HPOTerm":"Phocomelia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
