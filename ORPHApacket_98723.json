Pulmonary blood flow is diminished and right-to-left shunting occurs at the atrial level, leading to dyspnea, fatigue, atrial arrhythmias, right-sided heart failure, hypoxemia, repeated miscarriages that were mostly due to hypoxemia and cyanosis. Two subtypes of HRHS have been characterized: pulmonary atresia-intact ventricular septum and right ventricular hypoplasia (see these terms)."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}]}]}
