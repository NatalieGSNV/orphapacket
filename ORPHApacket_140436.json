Midline abnormalities, such as diastasis recti, supraumbilical raphe, and hiatus hernia, are commonly associated. Additional features reported include gingival bleeding, ectopic tooth eruption, exophthalmos, loss of vision, nausea, and vomiting."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"606893","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Intraosseous hemangioma"},{"lang":"en","label":"Osseous venous malformation"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"engulfment and cell motility 2"}],"Symbol":"ELMO2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"17233"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"606421"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410295","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (loss of function) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
