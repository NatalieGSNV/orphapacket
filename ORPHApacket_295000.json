Phenotypes range from only a mild skin indentation to complete amputation of parts of the fetus (e.g. digits, distal limb). Compression from the rings may lead to edema, skeletal anomalies (e.g. fractures, foot deformities) and, infrequently, neural compromise."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"217100","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Antenatal"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"5","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Amniotic band sequence"},{"lang":"en","label":"Amniotic band syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Congenital ring constrictions"},{"lang":"en","label":"Constriction band syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Streeter dysplasia"}]}]}]}
