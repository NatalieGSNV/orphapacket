  - Contents: Brazilian hemorrhagic fever, caused by the Sabia virus (a newly discovered
      arenavirus), is a viral hemorrhagic fever, believed to originate from Sao Paulo,
      Brazil, with only 3 reported cases (2 of which were due to laboratory accidents)
      to date, characterized by fever, nausea vomiting myalgia tremors, and hemorragic
      manifestations such as conjunctival petechia and haematemesis, leading potentially
      to shock, coma and death.
