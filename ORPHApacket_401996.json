Mild extrarenal manifestations, such as recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and abnormal liver function tests, may be associated. Renal biopsy reveals severe, chronic, interstitial fibrosis and tubular changes, as well as hallmark karyomegalic tubular epithelial cells which line the proximal and distal tubules and have enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614817","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"KIN"},{"lang":"en","label":"Systemic karyomegaly"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"FANCD2 and FANCI associated nuclease 1"}],"Symbol":"FAN1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"29170"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"613534"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
