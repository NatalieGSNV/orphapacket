  - Contents: Glycogen storage disease due to muscle and heart glycogen synthase deficiency
      is characterised by muscle and heart glycogen deficiency. It has been described
      in three siblings (two brothers and their younger sister). The older brother
      died at 10.5 years of age as a result of sudden cardiac arrest and the younger
      brother presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal heart rate and
      blood pressure during exercise, and muscle fatigability. The sister showed no
      symptoms but a lack of glycogen was identified through muscle biopsy. The syndrome
      is caused by homozygous missense mutations in the gene encoding muscle glycogen
      synthase.
