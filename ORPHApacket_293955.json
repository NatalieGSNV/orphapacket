Other manifestations include spasticity, seizures, truncal hypotonia, limb hypertonia, brisk tendon reflexes and reversible coma."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614458","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"thiamin pyrophosphokinase 1"}],"Symbol":"TPK1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"17358"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"606370"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410295","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (loss of function) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
