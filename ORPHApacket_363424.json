Clinical severity is variable and may range from mild cases which present a later onset with slow neurological deterioration and general improvement over time to severe cases with clinical signs since birth and leading to early death. Associated manifestations include hypotonia, vision loss, respiratory failure, seizures, and intellectual disability. Brain magnetic resonance imaging frequently shows cavitating leukoencephalopathy with lesions in the periventricular\/central white matter and parieto-occi\u00c3\u00aetal lobes."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"615330","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"IBA57 deficiency"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor IBA57"}],"Symbol":"IBA57","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"27302"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"615316"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
