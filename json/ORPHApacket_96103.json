            "Contents": "Distal trisomy 11q is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting from the partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 11 with high phenotypic variability principally characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism (brachycephaly/plagiocephaly low-set posteriorly rotated ears short philtrum micrognathia) and intellectual disability. Short stature and seizures as well as cardiac (e.g. atrial septal defect) skeletal (incl. brachy/syndactyly) and genital (e.g. micropenis cryptorchidism) abnormalities may also be associated. Neurodevelopmental anomalies (pain insensitivity sensorineural hearing loss expressive language deficiency) and neuropsychiatric disorders (autistic features auditory hallucination self-talking) have also been reported."
