Clinical findings include progressive neurological impairment hypotonia seizures failure to thrive and metabolic acidosis. Some patients had hyperglycinemia secondary to the organic acidemia. However some of the reported patients were asymptomatic. D-glyceric aciduria is caused by D-glycerate kinase deficiency. The <I>GLYCTK</I> gene has been mapped to 3p21."
