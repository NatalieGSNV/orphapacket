            "Contents": "A rare cutaneous myiasis characterized by infestation of humans by the larvae of horse or cattle bot flies. After penetration of the skin horse bot fly larvae form tunnels in the lower layers of the epidermis where they can migrate for up to several months causing serpentine erythematous lesions with intense pruritus. Cattle bot fly larvae penetrate deeper into the subcutaneous tissue producing more painful erythematous lesions which usually resolve after several hours or days when the larvae move on to infest another area."
