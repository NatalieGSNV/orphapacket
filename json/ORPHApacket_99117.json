Symptoms are variable and can include palpitations tachypnea dyspnea chest pain fatigue and cyanosis. The malformation may be associated with other cardiac anomalies such as coronary artery-coronary sinus fistula unroofed coronary sinus atrial septal defect coronary sinus-left atrium fistula total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and ventricular septal defect."
