Age of onset and disease course are variable with some cases presenting as severe fetal hydrops while most patients present in infancy or early childhood and progress to end-stage renal disease within a few years. Additional features include ichthyosis primary hypothyroidism hypogonadism immunodeficiency and neurological manifestations (such as cognitive impairment ataxia sensorineural hearing loss or seizures)."
