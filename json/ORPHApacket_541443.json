            "Contents": "A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the left coronary artery which originates from the right aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course which may be intramural prepulmonic subpulmonic retroaortic retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex. Patients are frequently asymptomatic although chest pain dyspnea palpitations dizziness syncope and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death so surgical revascularization is recommended even in cases with no associated evidence of myocardial ischemia."
