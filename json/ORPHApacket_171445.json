Patients present with difficulty climbing stairs a waddling gait marked winging of scapula lower back pain paresis of limb girdle musculature hypo-/areflexia and/or mild facial muscle weakness in rare cases. Respiratory muscle weakness is common and cardiac anomalies (conduction blocks tachycardia diastolic dysfunction left ventricular hypertrophy) have been reported in some cases."
