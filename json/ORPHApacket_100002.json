It presents as a well-circumscribed rarely encapsulated mass not associated with a recognizable nerve most commonly arising in the dermis and subcutis of the extremities or trunk or rarely in deep soft tissue or skin (e.g. in the stomach kidney pancreas maxillary sinus mandible bronchial tree and the face). The clinical presentation depends on the localization."
