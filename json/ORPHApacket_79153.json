In a less severe form the nails retain their luster and present with superficial ridging and multiple small geometric pits. In both varieties superficial scaling of the nail plate and hyperkeratosis of the cuticles as well as koilonychia and onychoschizia are observed. Any number of nails may be affected and fingernails are more often affected than toenails. Spontaneous improvement of the condition may occur."
