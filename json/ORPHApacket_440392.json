Typical presentation in infancy includes dyspnea cough wheezing and gradual cyanosis with or without failure to thrive. Radiological findings include diffuse ground-glass opacities in neonates later interstitial thickening associated with lung hyperinflation intraparenchymal/subpleural cysts honeycombing subpleural nodules or bronchiectasis. Infiltrates and air leaks are frequent complications."
