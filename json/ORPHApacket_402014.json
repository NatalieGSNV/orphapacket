Frequently associated with multilineage bone marrow dysplasia it usually presents with anemia thrombocytopenia (often pancytopenia) and other nonspecific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising recurrent infections bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement (gingivitis splenomegaly). Basophilia as well as poor response to chemotherapy has been reported."
