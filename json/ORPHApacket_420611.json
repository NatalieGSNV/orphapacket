Peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts display features suggestive of megakaryoblasts. In addition to trisomy 21 acquired GATA1 mutations are present in blast cells. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with thrombocytopenia less commonly other cytopenias leukocytosis hepatosplenomegaly jaundice ascites respiratory distress bleeding and pericardial or pleural effusions. Most patients undergo spontaneous remission within the first three months of life although some may develop life-threatening hepatic renal or cardiac complications."
