Lung biopsy reveals diffuse alveolar damage interstitial thickening with inflammatory infiltrates fibroblast proliferation collagen deposition and multiple foci of fibrosis alveolar type II cell hyperplasia abundant foamy alveolar macrophages and granular lipoproteic material in the alveolar lumen. Imaging shows cystic spaces and ground-glass opacities that are typically homogenously diffuse."
