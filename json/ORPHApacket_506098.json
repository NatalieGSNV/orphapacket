            "Contents": "A rare neuroendocrine neoplasm of pancreas characterized by a high-grade malignant epithelial tumor with neuroendocrine differentiation. Based on histopathologic appearance a small cell (composed of diffuse sheets of cells) and a large cell type (showing a nesting/trabecular pattern) are distinguished. Synaptophysin and chromogranin are positive on immunohistochemistry. The Ki-67 proliferation index is typically very high (>60 - 80%). Patients present with back pain jaundice and/or non-specific abdominal symptoms. Serum hormone activity is unusual. The tumor is highly aggressive with poor prognosis."
