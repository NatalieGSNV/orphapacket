            "Contents": "A subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities characterized by leukocytosis thrombocytosis and nonspecific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoiesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising recurrent infections bone pain) with frequent extramedullary involvement typically presenting as gingival hyperplasia and lymphadenopathy. The disease is characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid blasts harboring mutations of the <i>NPM1</i> gene in the bone marrow blood and other tissues. It is associated with multilineage dysplasia involving the myeloid monocytic erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lineages."
