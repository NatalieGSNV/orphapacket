Patients present recurrent respiratory infections otitis media bronchitis gastroenteritis or allergic symptoms in the first two to four years of life before the condition resolves spontaneously. Some children may remain asymptomatic and severe or life-threatening infections are rare. The capacity to synthesize specific antibodies in response to vaccines is usually normal."
