            "Contents": "Startle epilepsy is a rare neurologic disease characterized by frequent and spontaneous epileptic seizures (frequently with symmetrical or asymmetrical tonic features) triggered by a normal startle in response to a sudden and unexpected somatosensory (most frequently auditory) stimulus. Falls are common and can be traumatic. In most cases the disease is associated with spastic hemi- di- or tetraplegia and intellectual disability."
