Early symptoms include exertional dyspnea non-productive cough chest tightness and reduced exercise performance followed by dyspnea at rest and possibly orthopnea as well as gurgling in the chest and pink frothy sputum in advanced cases. Clinical signs are cyanosis tachypnea tachycardia crackles or wheezing and elevated body temperature (generally not exceeding 38.5\u00b0C). Signs of concomitant high-altitude cerebral edema may also be observed. Chest x-rays typically show patchy opacities predominantly in the right middle lobe."
