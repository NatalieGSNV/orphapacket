            "Contents": "A rare localized variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome characterized by rapidly progressive bilateral facial nerve palsy distal paresthesias and minimal or no motor weakness. Deep tendon reflexes are usually diminished or absent but can be present or even exaggerated in rare cases. CSF analysis may reveal albuminocytologic dissociation. Nerve conduction velocity studies often show demyelinating type of neuropathy although axonal polyneuropathy has been also described."
