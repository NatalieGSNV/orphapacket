            "Contents": "A rare myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a clonal proliferation of eosinophilic precursors with persistent increase of eosinophils in peripheral blood and bone marrow accompanied by increased blasts (<20%) or clonal cytogenetic or molecular genetic abnormalities. Cases with BCR-ABL1 PCM1-JAK2 ETV6-JAK2 or BCR-JAK2 fusion or rearrangement of PDGFRA PDGFRB or FGFR1 are not included in this entity. Infiltration of the liver and spleen as well as a variety of other organs is typical. Patients may present with constitutional symptoms and signs and symptoms of organ involvement such as endomyocardial fibrosis peripheral neuropathy central nervous system manifestations respiratory symptoms or rheumatological findings. Acute transformation is common."
