It occurs typically in infants and usually presents with hepatosplenomegaly anemia thrombocytopenia and nonspecific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoiesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising recurrent infections). Myelofibrosis and fibrosis of other infiltrated organs is also characteristic of this disease."
