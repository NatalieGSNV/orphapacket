Newborns are often large for gestational age with mild to moderate hepatomegaly and diffuse form of hyperinsulinism due to SUR1 deficiency. Persistent hypoglycemia hyperglycemia and type1 diabetes mellitus may develop later in life. Life-threatening hypoglycemic coma or status epilepticus have also been associated."
