Infection of muscle tissue is generally asymptomatic. Cyst development in the brain and spinal cord is known as neurocysticercosis (NCC) and may cause seizures and headache. NCC can follow a serious course and may be life-threatening. Severe cases of cysticercosis are treated with albendazole and anti-inflammatory drugs."
