            "Contents": "A rare disorder of the anterior segment of the eye characterized by a unilateral or bilateral rapidly progressive intractable painful ulcerative keratitis which initially affects the peripheral cornea and may spread circumferentially and then centrally. The destructive process involves stromal corneal tissue only leaving the epithelium and endothelium largely unaffected. There is no involvement of the adjacent sclera. The condition can be complicated by glaucoma cataract and perforation."
