            "Contents": "Rectal duplication is a rare congenital anorectal malformation characterized by an egg-like cystic mucus-filled mass composed of intestinal mucosal lining and smooth muscle tissue. Commonly it presents in childhood with symptoms of recurrent urinary tract infections gastroenteritis obstruction perianal sepsis and rectal bleeding. Drainage of mucus or pus from the anus is also a typical presenting sign. The majority are found in the retro-rectal space where they communicate with or are contiguous to the rectum."
