            "Contents": "Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a rare neoplastic lesion of the submucosal stroma which can develop in any organ often occurring in the lung mesentery omentum and the retroperitoneal region. It is histologically heterogenous composed of spindle-shaped cells myofibroblasts and inflammatory cells. It is usually benign however local invasion recurrence malignant transformation with vascular invasion and metastases may occur. The presentation is nonspecific and depends on the organ involved. Some patients may present with paraneoplastic syndrome (fever malaise weight loss anemia thrombocytosis) or symptoms related to compression of adjacent organs such as bowel obstruction."
