The tumors most commonly occur in the second or third decade of life. They are typically located in the gonads occasionally also in other regions. Patients present with a pelvic mass and/or abdominal pain (females) or an often painless unilateral testicular mass (males). Elevated serum alpha fetoprotein is a common laboratory finding."
