It is characterized by dermatitis (symmetrical photodistributed erythema that may be accompanied by vesicles and bullae and that develops into hyperkeratotic and hyperpigmented skin) gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea) and neuropsychiatric disorders (dementia). It can be life-threatening without a correct management."
