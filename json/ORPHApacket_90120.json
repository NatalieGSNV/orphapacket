Patients typically present distal limb muscle weakness and atrophy hypo/areflexia foot deformities poor visual acuity (often with a central scotoma) nystagmus and reduced peripheral and nocturnal vision. Additional reported manifestations include sensorineural hearing loss major joint contractures anosmia scoliosis/lumbar hyperlordosis cognitive impairment and vocal cord paresis."
