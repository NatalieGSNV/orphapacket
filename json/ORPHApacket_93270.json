Affected patients also have extreme micromelia pointed metaphyses and a range of other ossification defects (vertebrae calvaria pelvis hand and foot bones). Extraskeletal manifestations may include polycystic kidneys transposition of the great vessels and atresia of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems."
