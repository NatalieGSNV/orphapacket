It has been described in five members of one family two of whom died from renal failure. The association of Boichis syndrome with tapetoretinal degeneration and intellectual deficit has also been reported in one family: the so-called Senior-Boichis syndrome could be in fact the same entity and was later reported in a 12 year-old child."
