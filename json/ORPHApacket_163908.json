            "Contents": "Limbic encephalitis with LGI1 antibodies is a rare neuroimmunological disorder characterized by the onset of cognitive decline psychiatric disturbances and seizures (distinctively faciobrachial dystonic seizures) in association with detection of LGI1 antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid. Patients may present with confusion hallucinations vocalization paranoia tangentiality aggressive outbursts and/or spatial disorientation as well as obstinate hyponatremia. It is most often non-paraneoplastic however comorbid tumors such as small cell lung cancer and thymoma have been reported."
