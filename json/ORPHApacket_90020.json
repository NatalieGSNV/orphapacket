Oculomotor signs olfactory dysfunction and autonomic disturbances may also be observed. Neuropathological hallmarks are frontotemporally accentuated cerebral atrophy as well as neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss in a characteristic distribution in cortical and subcortical regions. The disease is endemic to the Pacific island of Guam."
