Patients typically present at birth (or shortly thereafter) with stridor, weak or breathy cry, dysphonia or aphonia, feeding or aspiration difficulties and, occasionally, respiratory compromise. Neurological disease, masses that cause compression and aberrant vessels are often associated. Most cases resolve spontaneously over 6-12 months."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Congenital vocal cord paralysis"}]}]}]}
