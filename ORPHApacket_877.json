These tumours may be localized in any part of the body and are generally discovered in non-specific situations, i.e. not immediately suggestive of NETs (tests for inherited predisposition to tumours or for a clinical syndrome caused by abnormal hormone secretion)."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Unknown"}]}]}]}]}
