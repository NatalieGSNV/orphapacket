- TextSection:
  - Contents: Idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy is a rare otorhinolaryngologic disease
      characterized by dysfunction of both peripheral labyrinths or of the eighth
      cranial nerves, which presents with persistent unsteadiness of gait (particularly
      in darkness, during eye closure or under impaired visual conditions, or when
      standing/walking on uneven, soft or wobbly ground) and oscillopsia associated
      with head movements. The disease may be progressive, presenting no episodes
      of vertigo, or sequential, presenting recurrent episodes of vertigo.
