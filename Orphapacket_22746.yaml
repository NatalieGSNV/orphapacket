- TextSection:
  - Contents: KLHL9-related early-onset distal myopathy is a rare, genetic distal
      myopathy characterized by slowly progressive distal limb muscle weakness and
      atrophy (beginning with anterior tibial muscle involvement followed by the intrinsic
      hand muscles) in association with reduced sensation in a stocking-glove distribution.
      Patients present with high stepping gait, ankle areflexia and contractures in
      the first to second decade of life, associated with marked ankle extensor muscle
      atrophy; later proximal muscle involvement is moderate and ambulation is preserved
      throughout the life.
