Patients are often asymptomatic for long periods of time and therefore, disease is often locally advanced or metastatic at the time of diagnosis. In cases with metastatic spread, bone pain, cough, dyspnea, pneumonia or neurological compromise may be associated."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"4","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"BDC"},{"lang":"en","label":"Bellini carcinoma"},{"lang":"en","label":"Bellini duct carcinoma"},{"lang":"en","label":"CDC"}]}]}]}
