- TextSection:
  - Contents: T-B- severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID; see this term) is a group
      of rare monogenic primary immunodeficiency disorders characterized by a lack
      of functional peripheral T and B lymphocytes, resulting in recurrent early-onset
      severe respiratory viral, bacterial or fungal infections, diarrhea and failure
      to thrive. Hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation is a characteristic feature
      of some of its sub-types.
