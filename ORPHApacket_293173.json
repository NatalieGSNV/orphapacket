Acute onset of fever (>38\u00c2\u00b0C), peripheral blood leukocytosis, and mild eosinophilia are accompanying features. Systemic involvement, with hepatic, renal or pulmonary dysfunction, occasionally occurs. Histologically reveals characteristic spongiform, subcorneal and\/or intraepidermal, pustules, as well as marked edema of the papillary dermis, a perivascularly accentuated, neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate, and intrapustular or intradermal eosinophils."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Multigenic\/multifactorial"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"AGEP"},{"lang":"en","label":"Pustular drug eruption"},{"lang":"en","label":"Toxic pustuloderma"}]}]}]}
