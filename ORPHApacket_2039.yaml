- TextSection:
  - Contents: Congenital systemic arteriovenous fistula is a rare, potentially life-threatening,
      vascular malformation characterized by a direct communication between an artery
      and a vein, without the interposition of the capillary bed, ocurring in the
      systemic circulation (mainly the cranium, liver, lungs, extremities, and vessels
      in or near the thoracic wall). Manifestations are variable depending on size
      and extent of the fistula, the involved blood vessels and the precise location
      of the collaterals and may include systolic or continuous murmur over the affected
      organ, tachycardia, increased stroke volume, cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary
      vascular markings.
