      variable phenotype, typically characterized by mild to severe global development
      delay, severe speech and language impairment, mild to severe intellectual disability,
      dysphagia, hypotonia, relative to true macrocephaly, and behavioral problems
      that may include autistic features, hyperactivity, and mood lability. Facial
