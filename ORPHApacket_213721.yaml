  - Contents: Undifferentiated carcinoma of the corpus uteri is a rare cancer of corpus
      uteri presenting as a large, polypoid, intraluminal mass with necrosis, composed
      of small to intermediate-size, relatively uniform, dyshesive cells displaying
      no differentiation. It usually presents with dysfunctional bleeding or vaginal
      discharge and, less often, abdominal pain. Association with Lynch syndrome was
      reported.
