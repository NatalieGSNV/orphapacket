  - Contents: Tetrasomy 21 is an extremely rare autosomal anomaly resulting from the
      presence of 4 copies of chromosome 21, characterized by features of trisomy
      21 including developmental delay/intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia,
      short neck with redundant skin, brachycephaly, microcephaly, flat face, epicanthus,
      upslanted palpebral fissures, small ears, protruding tongue, single transverse
      palmar crease, brachydactyly, hypoplastic iliac wings, together with additional
      features such as prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, high and broad
