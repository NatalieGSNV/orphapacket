Patients are mostly asymptomatic between acute epidodes. HMG-CoA synthase deficiency requires an early diagnosis in order to avoid hypoglycemic crises that can lead to permanent brain damage or death."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"605911","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"HMG-CoA synthase deficiency"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2"}],"Symbol":"HMGCS2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"5008"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"600234"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410295","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (loss of function) in"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"3","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0001250","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001250","HPOTerm":"Seizures","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001939","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001939","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of metabolism\/homeostasis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001943","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001943","HPOTerm":"Hypoglycemia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
