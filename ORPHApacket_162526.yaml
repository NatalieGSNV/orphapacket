- TextSection:
  - Contents: Isolated congenital auditory ossicle malformation is a rare, congenital,
      middle ear anomaly characterized by, usually unilateral and sporadic, variations
      in the number, size and/or configuration of the ossicles, with no tympanic membrane
      and external ear abnormalities and no history of trauma or infection. Patients
      frequently present late, after schooling has started, with non-progressive,
      conductive hearing loss often associated with speech delay and poor school performance.
