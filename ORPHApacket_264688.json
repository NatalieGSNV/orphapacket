Congenital chylothorax is the most common cause of pleural effusion in neonates; it can occur primarily due to developmental anomalies of the lymphatic duct or can be associated with chromosomal anomalies (e.g. Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome and Down syndrome), hydrops fetalis, mediastinal neuroblastoma and other congenital malformations."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"603523","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Unknown"}]}]}]}]}
