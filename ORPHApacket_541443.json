Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest\/death at any age (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death so surgical revascularization is recommended even in cases with no associated evidence of myocardial ischemia."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"AOLCA"},{"lang":"en","label":"L-ACAOS"},{"lang":"en","label":"Left coronary artery from right aortic sinus"}]}]}]}
