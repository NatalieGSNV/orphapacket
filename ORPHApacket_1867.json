Two families (one of whom was Dutch and the other Italian) have been described up to now, in which only males were affected. Transmission is X-linked recessive. The bullous dystrophy locus has been mapped to Xq26.3 in the Italian family and to Xq27.3 in the Dutch family."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"302000","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"X-linked recessive"}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"10","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000078","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000078","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the genital system","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000252","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000252","HPOTerm":"Microcephaly","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001063","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001063","HPOTerm":"Acrocyanosis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001182","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001182","HPOTerm":"Tapered finger","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001249","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001249","HPOTerm":"Intellectual disability","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001597","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001597","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the nail","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0007418","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0007418","HPOTerm":"Alopecia totalis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0007440","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0007440","HPOTerm":"Generalized hyperpigmentation","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0008066","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0008066","HPOTerm":"Abnormal blistering of the skin","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0011362","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0011362","HPOTerm":"Abnormal hair quantity","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
