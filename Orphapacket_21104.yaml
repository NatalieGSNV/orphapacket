- TextSection:
  - Contents: Connective tissue disorder due to lysyl hydroxylase-3 deficiency is
      a rare, genetic disease, caused by lack of lysyl hydrohylase 3 (LH3) activity,
      characterized by multiple tissue and organ involvement, including skeletal abnormalities
      (club foot, progressive scoliosis, osteopenia, pathologic fractures), ocular
      involvement (flat retinae, myopia, cataracts) and hair, nail and skin anomalies
      (coarse, abnormally distributed hair, skin blistering, reduced palmar creases,
      hypoplastic nails). Patients also present intrauterine growth retardation, facial
      dysmorphism (flat facial profile, low-set ears, shallow orbits, short and upturned
      nose, downturned corners of mouth) and joint flexion contractures. Growth and
      developmental delay, bilateral sensorineural deafness, friable diaphragm and
      later-onset spontaneous vascular ruptures are additional reported features.
