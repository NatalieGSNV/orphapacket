  - Contents: A very rare, aggressive form of systemic mastocytosis characterized
      by abnormal growth and proliferation of neoplastic mast cells (<10%) in the
      bone marrow and/or blood, as well as other tissues such as the liver, peritoneum,
      spleen or bones. Patients typically present with symptoms related to mast cell
      activation (e.g. hot flushes, fever, malaise, diarrhea, tachycardia), weight
      loss, anorexia, hepatosplenomegaly or, less frequently, cutaneous mastocytosis.
      Gastroduodenal ulcers (often complicated by hemorrhage), ascites and portal
      hypertension have also been reported.
