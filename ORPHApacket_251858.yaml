- TextSection:
  - Contents: Medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN) is a histological variant
      of medulloblastoma (see this term), an embryonic malignancy, most often located
      in the inferior medullary velum and then growing into the fourth ventricle,
      and presenting in infants and young children with symptoms of increased intracranial
      pressure such as headache, listlessness, vomiting, diplopia and papilledema.
      It is often associated with Gorlin syndrome (see this term) and has a relatively
      good prognosis.
