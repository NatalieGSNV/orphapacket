  - Contents: A rare, life-threatening, congenital, non-syndromic, conotruncal heart
      malformation disease characterized by absent or severely undeveloped pulmonary
      valve leaflets (with a restrictive ring of thickened tissue at the place of
      the pulmonary valve annulus), associated with an intact ventricular septum and
      a patent ductus arteriosus, manifesting with marked respiratory insufficiency.
      Additional features include dilated main pulmonary artery (with or without dilatation
      of pulmonary artery branches), to-and-fro flow at site of the dysplastic pulmonary
      valve, and systolic pressure gradient across narrowed pulmonary valve. Tricuspid
      atresia and variable extra-cardiac anomalies (e.g. diaphragmatic hernia or cleft
      lip/palate), may be present.
