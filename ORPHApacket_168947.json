It usually presents as chronic eosinophilic leukemia or, less commonly, as acute myeloid leukemia or T-lymphoblastic leukemia with eosinophilia. Patients usually present with eosinophilia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, fever, sweating and\/or weight loss. Tissue infiltration by eosinophils can manifest with skin rash, erythema, cough, neurological alterations, gastrointestinal symptoms or, rarely, endomyocardial fibrosis and restrictive cardiomyopathy."}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha"}],"Symbol":"PDGFRA","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"8803"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"173490"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317348","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Part of a fusion gene in"}]}]}]}]}]}
