- TextSection:
  - Contents: Secondary pulmonary hemosiderosis is a respiratory disease due to the
      deposition of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in lungs as a result of repeated
      alveolar hemorrhage secondary to another disease, especially dysimmunitary disorders
      (i.e. Heiner syndrome (see this term), autoimmune diseases), thrombotic disorders
      and cardiovascular disorders such as mitral stenosis. It manifests as a triad
      of hemoptysis, anemia and diffuse parenchymal infiltrates on chest radiography
