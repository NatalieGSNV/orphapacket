Additional manifestations include brachydactyly with bilateral clinodactyly and hypoplastic middle phalanx of the fifth digit. X-ray demonstrated an apparent Y-shaped or bifid distal clavicle. Cleidorhizomelic syndrome has been reported in one family (mother and son) and is suspected to be transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner.
