- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome, resulting from the partial deletion
      of the short arm of chromosome X, principally characterized by classical Norrie
      disease (bilateral, severe retinal malformations and opacity of the lens leading
      to congenital blindness, on occasion associated with progressive sensorineural
      deafness and intellectual disability), microcephaly, hypotonia, psychomotor
      and growth delay, moderate to severe mental handicap and disruptive behaviour.
      Clinical phenotype is highly variable and immunodeficiency, epilepsy and hypogonadism
      have also been reported.
