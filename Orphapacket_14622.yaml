- TextSection:
  - Contents: Primary interstitial lung disease specific to childhood due to pulmonary
      surfactant protein anomalies is a group of interstitial lung diseases (ILD)
      induced by genetic mutations disrupting surfactant function and gas exchange
      in the lung. The disorders caused by these mutations affect full-term infants
      and older children and exhibit considerable overlap in their clinical and histologic
      presentation.
