- TextSection:
  - Contents: Leiomyosarcoma of the corpus uteri is a rare, malignant, mesenchymal
      tumor of smooth muscle origin characterized, histologically, by spindle and/or
      pleomorphic cells, often forming disorganized fascicles, with tumor cell necrosis
      and, macroscopically, by a large, soft, usually intramural mass with irregular
      borders and necrotic and hemorrhagic areas, located in the uterus. Presenting
      signs and symptoms typically include dysfunctional vaginal bleeding, vaginal
      discharge, palpable pelvic mass and/or pelvic pain/pressure. Changes in bowel
      habits, frequent or painful urination and hematuria may also be associated.
