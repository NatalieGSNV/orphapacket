- TextSection:
  - Contents: Congenital laryngeal cyst is a rare larynx anomaly characterized by
      a cyst involving the larynx or supraglottis locations, such as the epiglottis
      and vallecula. Timing and severity of presentation depend on the size of the
      cyst and its proximity to the glottis and range from severe prenatal airway
      obstruction leading to polyhydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia to postnatal
      inspiratory stridor associated with muffled cry, hoarseness and cyanotic episodes,
      and to feeding difficulties and failure to thrive. It can be associated with
      laryngomalacia.
