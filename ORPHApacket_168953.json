It usually presents as myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia, T lymphoblastic lymphoma with eosinophilia or, less frequently, acute myeloid leukemia. The presenting signs and symptoms include eosinophilia, leukocytosis with leukemoid reaction, monocytosis, fatigue, sweating, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and\/or hepatomegaly. Extranodal involvement may include the tonsils, lungs and breasts."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"613523","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Stem cell leukemia\/lymphoma"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"fibroblast growth factor receptor 1"}],"Symbol":"FGFR1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"3688"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"136350"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317348","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Part of a fusion gene in"}]}]}]}]}]}
