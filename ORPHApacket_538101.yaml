- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, congenital, autosomal recessive axonal hereditary motor and
      sensory neuropathy disease characterized by axonal neuropathy, manifesting at
      birth or shortly thereafter with generalized muscular hypotonia, prominently
      distal muscular weakness, respiratory/swallowing difficulties and diffuse areflexia,
      associated with central nervous system involvement, which includes progressive
      microcephaly, seizures, and global developmental delay. Additional variable
      manifestations include hearing impairment, ocular lesions, skeletal anomalies
      (e.g. talipes equinovarus, overriding toes, scoliosis, joint contractures),
      cryptorchidism, and dysmorphic features (such as coarse facies, hypertelorism,
      high-arched palate). Outcome is typically poor due to respiratory insufficiency
      and/or aspiration pneumonia.
