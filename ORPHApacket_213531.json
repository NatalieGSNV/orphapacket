Histologically, the tumor shows high-grade cellularity and heterologous differentiation, including chondroid, osseous, pleomorphic\/sarcomatoid, spindled, and squamous elements. Patients usually present with a fast-growing, large, well-circumscribed, mobile lump in the breast, which can become painful and involve the chest wall and the skin, leading to ulceration."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}]}]}
