The tumor arises preferentially in elderly individuals in superficial soft tissues and skin, with a predilection for the head and neck region, although all areas of the body may be affected. Macroscopically it typically presents as an ill-defined violaceous plaque which may develop a thicker, nodular surface, including ulceration and hemorrhage as the disease progresses. Angiosarcomas are very aggressive tumors with poor prognosis."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
