- TextSection:
  - Contents: 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B (CMT1B) is a form of CMT1 (see
      this term), caused by mutations in the <i>MPZ</i> gene (1q22), that presents
      with the manifestations of peripheral neuropathy (distal muscle weakness and
      atrophy, foot deformities and sensory loss). The phenotype is variable depending
      on the particular mutation. Two distinct presentations have been described:
      (1) an early infantile onset severe phenotype with delayed walking and motor
      nerve conduction velocities (MNCV) <10 m/s, often referred to as Dejerine-Sottas
      syndrome (see this term), or (2) a much later onset phenotype (>age 40), with
      normal or mildly slowed MNCV and more frequent hearing loss and pupillary abnormalities.
      CMT1B can also cause the classical CMT phenotype in about 15% of total CMT1B
      cases.'
