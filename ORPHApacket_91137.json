Both present clinically with nephrotic range proteinuria, hematuria and renal insufficiency leading to renal failure in many cases. ITG is more likely to manifest with underlying lymphoproliferative disease, hypocomplementemia, dysproteinemia, monoclonal gammopathy or occult cryoglobulinemia. Non-amyloid FGP is 10 times more frequent than ITG."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulonephritis"}]}]}]}
