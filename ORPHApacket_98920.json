Patients typically have a history of intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight, feeble cry, weak suck and failure to thrive and present with inspiratory stridor, recurrent episodes of dyspnea or apnea, cyanosis and absent deep tendon reflexes. Kyphosis\/scoliosis, foot deformities and joint contractures are frequently associated features."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"604320","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"10","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive distal spinal muscular atrophy type 1"},{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress"},{"lang":"en","label":"Diaphragmatic spinal muscular atrophy"},{"lang":"en","label":"Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 6"},{"lang":"en","label":"Distal-HMN type 6"},{"lang":"en","label":"SIANRF"},{"lang":"en","label":"SMARD1"},{"lang":"en","label":"Severe infantile axonal neuropathy with respiratory failure type 1"},{"lang":"en","label":"dHMN6"},{"lang":"en","label":"dSMA1"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"immunoglobulin mu DNA binding protein 2"}],"Symbol":"IGHMBP2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"5542"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"600502"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
