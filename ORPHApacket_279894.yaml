- TextSection:
  - Contents: Toxic maculopathy due to antimalarial drugs is a rare, acquired eye
      disease, due to long-term exposure to chloroquinine (CQ) or hydrochloroquinine
      (HCQ), characterized by a slowly progressive, usually non-reversible, development
      of bilateral atrophic bull's-eye maculopathy (progressive loss of central vision
      acuity, reduced color vision and central scotoma), which in severe cases can
      spread over the entire fundus, leading to widespread retinal atrophy and visual
      loss.
