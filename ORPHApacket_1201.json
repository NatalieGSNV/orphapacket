Newborns are usually preterm infants with low birth-weights, that encounter feeding difficulties (including vomiting with initial feeds, which may later worsened and the abdomen becomes progressively distended) as well as failure to thrive. Affected children present disrupted bowel loops assuming a spiral configuration resembling an 'apple peel' and may have less than half of the normal length of the small bowel and a physiologically short bowel. This disorder is characterized by jejunal atresia near the ligament of Treitz, foreshortened bowel, and a large mesenteric gap. The bowel distal to the atresia is precariously supplied. It may be a manifestation of cystic fibrosis and the most important cause of mortality is short bowel syndrome, encountered in 65% of cases."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"243600","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"3","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Multigenic\/multifactorial"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"5","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Apple peel syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"Intestinal atresia type IIIb"},{"lang":"en","label":"Jejunal atresia"},{"lang":"en","label":"Jejunoileal atresia"},{"lang":"en","label":"Small intestinal atresia"}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"10","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0004322","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0004322","HPOTerm":"Short stature","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0005235","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0005235","HPOTerm":"Jejunal atresia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0011968","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0011968","HPOTerm":"Feeding difficulties","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0025015","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0025015","HPOTerm":"Abnormal vascular morphology","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0005245","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0005245","HPOTerm":"Intestinal hypoplasia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001508","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001508","HPOTerm":"Failure to thrive","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001511","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001511","HPOTerm":"Intrauterine growth retardation","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002013","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002013","HPOTerm":"Vomiting","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002566","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002566","HPOTerm":"Intestinal malrotation","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0003270","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0003270","HPOTerm":"Abdominal distention","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
