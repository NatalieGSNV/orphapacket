- TextSection:
  - Contents: Isosporiasis (also known as cystoisosporiasis) is an exclusively human
      parasitosis occurring mainly in the tropics and subtropics, due to infection
      with <i>Isospora belli</i> (through ingestion of contaminated food), that is
      frequently asymptomatic or that can cause fever and diarrhea, but that is usually
      a self-limiting condition in the immunocompetent. HIV-positive individuals are
      particularly at risk of suffering from symptomatic isosporiasis and can manifest
      with a more severe clinical course of chronic diarrhea and severe weight loss.
