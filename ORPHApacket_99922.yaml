- TextSection:
  - Contents: Ocular pemphigoid is a rare inflammatory eye disease characterized by
      sub-epithelial blistering manifesting with bilateral, asymmetrical, chronic
      or recurrent conjunctivitis and aberrant tissue regeneration leading to progressive
      conjunctival fibrosis, secondary corneal vascularization and, in some cases,
      blindness. Patients typically present with conjunctival redness, increased lacrimation,
      burning and/or foreign body sensation, edema, limbitis and/or varying degrees
      of ocular pain. Ankyloblepharon may be observed in end stages of the disease.
