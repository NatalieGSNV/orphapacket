  - Contents: Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci is a rare genetic epilepsy
      disorder characterized by autosomal dominant lesional and nonlesional focal
      epilepsy with variable penetrance. Focal seizures emanate from different cortical
      locations (temporal, frontal, centroparietal, parietal, parietaloccipital, occipital)
      in different family members, but for each individual a single focus remains
      constant throughout lifetime. Seizure type (tonic, tonic-clonic or hyperkinetic)
      and severity varies among family members and tends to decrease (but do not disappear)
      during adulthood. Many patients have an aura and show automatisms during diurnal
      seizures whereas others have nocturnal seizures. Most individuals are of normal
      intelligence but patients with intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder
      and obsessive-compulsive disorder have been described.
