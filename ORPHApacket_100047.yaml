- TextSection:
  - Contents: Esophageal duplication cyst is a rare, congenital, non-syndromic esophageal
      malformation, most frequently located in the distal esophagus and usually diagnosed
      in childhood, characterized by tubular or spherical cystic masses that have
      a double layer of surrounding smooth muscle lined with squamous or enteric epithelium,
      are continuous or contiguous to the esophagus and may, or may not, communicate
      with the esophageal lumen. Patients are frequently asymptomatic, or could present
      with a wide range of symptoms including respiratory distress, failure to thrive,
      dysphagia, epigastric discomfort, vomiting, stridor, non-productive cough, and
      chest pain. Other more rare symptoms, such as cardiac arrhythmia, thoracic back
      pain, cystic hemorrgage and ulceration, and mediastinitis, have also been reported.
