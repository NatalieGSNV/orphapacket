The neoplastic cells often show rearrangements involving the mixed lineage leukemia gene at 11q23. This subgroup of t-MN is typically associated with overt leukemia, without preceding myelodysplastic syndrome, developing 2-3 years after exposure, presenting with non-specific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue, bleeding and bruising, recurrent infections, bone pain) and\/or extramedullary site involvement."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"AML and myelodysplastic syndromes related to topoisomerase type 2 inhibitor"}]}]}]}
