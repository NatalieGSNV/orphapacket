It is commonly asymptomatic and discovered inadvertently, but symptoms may include pain and discomfort or stiffness when using the shoulder. The presence of a firm mass masked by the scapula during retropulsion of the shoulder and becoming prominent when the shoulder is displaced toward the front is a frequent sign. Neuromuscular involvement of the upper limb may occur in rare cases."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
