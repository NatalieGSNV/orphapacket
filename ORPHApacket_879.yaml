- TextSection:
  - Contents: Tungiasis is a parasitic skin disease caused by the female sand flea
      <i>Tunga penetrans</i>. The disease is characterized by acute (multiple white,
      gray, or yellowish papular or nodular lesions with brown-black-colored opening
      at the center and peripheral erythema) and chronic inflammation in the feet
      with itchy/ painful lesions. Bacterial superinfection is common and result in
      debilitating clinical pathology (deep ulcers, gangrene, lymphangitis and septicemia),
      leading to impaired physical fitness and mobility. Tungiasis also involves hyperkeratosis,
      fissuration, nail hypertrophy, and loss of nails.
