Lymphadenopathy, anemia, mild to moderate pruritus and increased incidence of other infections (e.g. crusted scabies) have also been reported in some patients. Patients may subsequently develop other HTLV-1 associated conditions such as adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis (see these terms)."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"IDH"},{"lang":"en","label":"Infective dermatitis associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1"},{"lang":"en","label":"Infective dermatitis associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type I"}]}]}]}
