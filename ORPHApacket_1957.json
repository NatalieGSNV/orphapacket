With early treatment and in the absence of distant metastases, ENB appears to have a good prognosis (compared to other superior nasal malignancies), despite a high rate of cervical metastases."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Elderly"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Olfactory neuroblastoma"}]}]}]}
