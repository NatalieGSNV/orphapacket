  - Contents: Male infertility due to large-headed multiflagellar polypoid spermatozoa
      is a male infertility due to sperm disorder characterized by the presence, in
      sperm, of a very high percentage of spermatozoa with enlarged head, irregular
      head shape, multiple flagella, and abnormal midpiece and acrosome. It is generally
      associated with severe oligoasthenozoospermia and a high rate of sperm chromosomal
      abnormalities (polyploidy, aneuploidy).
