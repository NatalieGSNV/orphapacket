Onset may be spontaneous in some patients. Manifestations begin shortly after the stimulus, persist for 6 months to years and may be associated with anxiety, fatigue and impaired cognition. Symptoms are often accentuated when in an enclosed space or when attempting to be motionless (sitting, lying down or standing in a stationary position) and are relieved when in passive motion such as in a moving car, airplane or train."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"4","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disembarkment syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"MdD"},{"lang":"en","label":"MdDS"},{"lang":"en","label":"Sickness of disembarkment"}]}]}]}
