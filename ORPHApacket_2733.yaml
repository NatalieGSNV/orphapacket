- TextSection:
  - Contents: 'Omodysplasia is a rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by severe limb
      shortening and facial dysmorphism. Two types of omodysplasia have been described:
      an autosomal recessive or generalized form (also referred to as micromelic dysplasia
      with dislocation of radius) marked by severe micromelic dwarfism with predominantly
      rhizomelic shortening of both the upper and lower limbs, and an autosomal dominant
      form in which stature is normal and shortening is limited to the upper limbs.'
