Patients are usually asymptomatic however, screening reveals increased C3-acylcarnitine and MMA in plasma. Serum homocysteine levels may vary from normal to moderately elevated and retinal vascular occlusive disease, resulting in severe visual loss, has been reported."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"613646","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Methylmalonic acidemia, TCb1R type"},{"lang":"en","label":"Methylmalonic acidemia, TCbIR type"}]}]}]}
