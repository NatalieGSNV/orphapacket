- TextSection:
  - Contents: Glassy cell carcinoma of the cervix uteri is a rare cancer of the uterine
      cervix, composed of nests of large neoplastic cells with "ground glass" cytoplasm,
      surrounded by a stroma with prominent eosinophilic infiltrates. It is a poorly
      differentiated, aggressive variant of adenosquamous carcinoma that usually affects
      young women and presents with dysfunctional vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal
      pain. Distant metastases to the lungs, liver spleen or bones are often present
      at the time of diagnosis. It is often associated with high-risk HPV-infection
      (types 18, 16 and 32).
