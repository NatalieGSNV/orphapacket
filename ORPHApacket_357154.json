It is usually associated with the chewing of the areca nut (an ingredient in betel quid) but the exact etiology is unknown and there is currently no effective treatment."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"OSMF"}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"7","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000160","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000160","HPOTerm":"Narrow mouth","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000163","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000163","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the oral cavity","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000211","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000211","HPOTerm":"Trismus","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000600","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000600","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the pharynx","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001371","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001371","HPOTerm":"Flexion contracture","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0012182","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0012182","HPOTerm":"Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0100825","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0100825","HPOTerm":"Cheilitis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
