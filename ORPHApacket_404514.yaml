- TextSection:
  - Contents: Acquired cystic disease-associated renal cell carcinoma is a rare subtype
      of renal cell carcinoma, ocurring in the context of end-stage kidney disease
      and acquired cystic kidney disease, characterized by a usually well circumscribed,
      solid, multifocal, bilateral tumor with inter- or intracellular microlumen formation
      (leading to cribiform architecture). Tumors are often diagnosed incidentally
      in early stages, although complications caused by renal cysts (dull flank or
      abdominal pain, fever) or renal parenchymal bleeding may mask the underlying
      neoplastic process. Most have an indolent behavior.
