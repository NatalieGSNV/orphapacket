- TextSection:
  - Contents: Unilateral choanal atresia is a, usually sporadic, congenital anomaly
      that is more commonly seen in females than in males (2:1), where the nose is
      blocked by bony or soft tissue formed during embryologic development on only
      one side (more commonly on the right side) and which is characterized by nasal
      obstruction and rhinorrhea, usually presenting at birth but that may go undetected
      until a respiratory infection aggravates the condition.
