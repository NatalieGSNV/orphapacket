- TextSection:
  - Contents: Primary lymphoma of the conjunctiva is an extremely rare clonal lymphoid
      proliferation of the ocular surface, with an indolent course. Clinically it
      presents with treatment-resistant conjunctivitis, ptosis, excessive tear production
      or as a painless, salmon-pink, ''fleshy'' patch, with a smooth or multinodular
      surface, on the bulbar conjunctiva. Histologically it is usually B-cell Non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (most often extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, followed by follicular
      and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), with conjunctival T-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      being very rare.
