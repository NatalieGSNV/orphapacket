- TextSection:
  - Contents: Lower limb hypertrophy is a rare, genetic, non-syndromic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis disorder characterized by uni- or bilateral overgrowth
      of lower limbs involving bones and/or soft tissues and resulting in an abnormal
      increase in leg length and/or width. Hypertrophy presents either as a proportionate
      overgrowth of entire limb or involves only the proximal or distal parts of it.
      Phenotype ranges from mild hypertrophy without functional disability to massively
      hypertrophied limb with knee flexion and ankle equinus contractures and macrodystrophia
      lipomatosa. Patients may also present vascular abnormalities (e.g. cutaneous
      angiomas, varicose veins) and myalgia.
