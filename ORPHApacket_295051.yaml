  - Contents: A rare, genetic, non-syndromic developmental defect during embryogenesis
      disorder characterized by uni- or bilateral overgrowth of lower limbs involving
      bones and/or soft tissues and resulting in an abnormal increase in leg length
      and/or width. Hypertrophy presents either as a proportionate overgrowth of entire
      limb or involves only the proximal or distal parts of it. Phenotype ranges from
      mild hypertrophy without functional disability to massively hypertrophied limb
      with knee flexion and ankle equinus contractures and macrodystrophia lipomatosa.
      Patients may also present vascular abnormalities (e.g. cutaneous angiomas, varicose
      veins) and myalgia.
