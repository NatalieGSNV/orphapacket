It can present with signs of raised intracranial pressure (headache, vomiting, papilledema), hydrocephalus, seizures, ataxia and visual disturbances, or can be diagnosed incidentally in asymptomatic patients. The tumor usually arises in the midline, involving the fourth ventricle or the cerebellum."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"RGNT"}]}]}]}
