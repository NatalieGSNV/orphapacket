- TextSection:
  - Contents: Familial dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defect due to LMNA mutation
      is a rare familial dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by left ventricular
      enlargement and/or reduced systolic function preceded or accompanied by significant
      conduction system disease and/or arrhythmias including bradyarrhythmias, supraventricular
      or ventricular arrhythmias. Disease onset is usually in early to mid-adulthood.
      Sudden cardiac death may occur and may be the presenting symptom. In some cases,
      it is associated with skeletal myopathy and elevated serum creatine kinase.
