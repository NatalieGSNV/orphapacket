Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although vulvar pruritis\/pain\/burning, dysuria and\/or dyspareunia may be associated. Concurrent anogenital involvement is frequent. Two subtypes, usual type VIN (uVIN) and differentiated type VIN (dVIN) exist, with uVIN typically being associated with HPV infection and presenting multifocal, elevated lesions around the introitus and\/or labia majora, and dVIN being related to chronic inflammation and lesions consisting of poorly demarcated pink or white plaques that are often associated with lichen sclerosis or lichen planus. Diffusely positive p16 immunohistochemistry and high Ki-67 proliferation index in uVIN futher differentiates this subtype from dVIN, this latter being consistently negative for p16 while presenting p53 positivity."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Elderly"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"VIN"},{"lang":"en","label":"Vulvar intraepithelial tumor"}]}]}]}
