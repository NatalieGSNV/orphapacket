Clinically it presents with treatment-resistant conjunctivitis, ptosis, excessive tear production or as a painless, salmon-pink, ''fleshy'' patch, with a smooth or multinodular surface, on the bulbar conjunctiva. Histologically it is usually B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (most often extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, followed by follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), with conjunctival T-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma being very rare."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Primary lymphoid conjunctival tumor"}]}]}]}
