- TextSection:
  - Contents: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL; see this term) in adults characterized by a median age of presentation
      in the sixth decade of life (but also rarely occurring in adolescents and children)
      with the initial presentation being single or multiple rapidly growing masses
      (that may or may not be painful) in nodal or extranodal sites (such as thyroid,
      skin, breast, gastrointestinal tract, testes, bone, or brain) and that can be
      accompanied by symptoms of fever, night sweats and weight loss. DLBCL has an
      aggressive disease course, with the elderly having a poorer prognosis than younger
      patients, and with relapses being common.
