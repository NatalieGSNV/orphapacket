Patients usually present with hematuria and rapidly declining renal function, often leading to dialysis within weeks without treatment. Cutaneous, pulmonary, musculoskeletal and nervous involvement may be observed in case of systemic disease, and the correlation between ANCA titer and disease activity has been demonstrated."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Elderly"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody"}]}]}]}
