Bone marrow suppression and the incidence of developmental abnormalities are less frequent than in other FA, but cancer risk is very high with the spectrum of childhood cancers including Wilms tumor, brain tumor (often medulloblastoma) and ALL\/AML."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"605724","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BRCA2 DNA repair associated"}],"Symbol":"BRCA2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"1101"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"600185"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
