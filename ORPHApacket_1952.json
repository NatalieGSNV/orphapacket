It has been described in less than 10 patients but may be underdiagnosed. It is characterized radiographically by severe stippling of the lower spine and long bones, and periosteal cloaking. Patients also have short metacarpals. The syndrome may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. This disorder should be included in the differential diagnosis of mucolipidosis type II. In order to make a definitive diagnosis, lysosomal storage should be investigated by electron microscopy, or enzyme assays should be performed. Familial recurrence can be easily detected by prenatal ultrasonography. This skeletal dysplasia is lethal."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"167220","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Antenatal"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Epiphyseal stippling syndrome-osteoclastic hyperplasia syndrome"}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"10","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000601","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000601","HPOTerm":"Hypotelorism","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001643","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001643","HPOTerm":"Patent ductus arteriosus","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002648","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002648","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of calvarial morphology","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0002970","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0002970","HPOTerm":"Genu varum","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0003417","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0003417","HPOTerm":"Coronal cleft vertebrae","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0005716","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0005716","HPOTerm":"Lethal skeletal dysplasia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0006487","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0006487","HPOTerm":"Bowing of the long bones","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0010655","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0010655","HPOTerm":"Epiphyseal stippling","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0011849","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0011849","HPOTerm":"Abnormal bone ossification","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0100670","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0100670","HPOTerm":"Rough bone trabeculation","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
