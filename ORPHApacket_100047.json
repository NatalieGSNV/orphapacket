Patients are frequently asymptomatic, or could present with a wide range of symptoms including respiratory distress, failure to thrive, dysphagia, epigastric discomfort, vomiting, stridor, non-productive cough, and chest pain. Other more rare symptoms, such as cardiac arrhythmia, thoracic back pain, cystic hemorrgage and ulceration, and mediastinitis, have also been reported."}]}]}
