The attacks last seconds to minutes with intervals between the paroxysms ranging from a few minutes to a few hours, and appear in clusters lasting weeks to months, again with irregular intervals in between. Pain attacks are usually triggered by a specific stimulus but may also occur spontaneously. The condition can sometimes be associated with bradycardia, syncope, seizures, and even asystole, and is then termed vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia."}]}]}
