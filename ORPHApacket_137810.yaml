  - Contents: "Primary localized cutaneous nodular amyloidosis (PLCNA) is the most\
      \ rare form of primary cutaneous amyloidosis (see this term), a skin disease\
      \ characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits in the dermis, characterized\
      \ clinically by yellowish waxy crusted nodules and papules on the face, lower\
      \ extremities, trunk, scalp, and genitalia and histologically by the localized\
      \ deposition of immunoglobulin-derived amyloid in the papillary dermis and subcutis.\
      \ PLCNA can be associated with connective tissue disorders such as Sj\xC3\xB6\
      gren\xC2\x92s syndrome and CREST syndrome (see these terms)."
