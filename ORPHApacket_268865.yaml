- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, congenital, non-syndromic malformation of neurenteric canal,
      spinal cord and column, characterized by intraspinal, predominantly intradural-extramedullary
      cystic mass located typically ventral to the spinal cord. Histopathology reveals
      columnar or cuboidal epithelium with or without cilia and mucus globules. Patients
      may be asymptomatic or present with signs and symptoms of compression of the
      spinal cord and associated nerve roots, such as focal weakness, progressive
      paresis, paresthesias, gait disturbance, or radicular pain. Concomitant congenital
      vertebral anomalies are frequently observed.
