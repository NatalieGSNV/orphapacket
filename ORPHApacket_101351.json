Typically, the condition manifests with severe, recurrent, overwhelming infections (especially pneumococcal sepsis) in otherwise apparently healthy infants. In adults with no history of severe sepsis in infancy, thrombocytosis may be the presenting sign. Howell-Jolly bodies on blood smears and an absent spleen on abdominal ultrasound examination are highly suggestive associated findings."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"271400","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}]}]}
