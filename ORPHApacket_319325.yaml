- TextSection:
  - Contents: Tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma is an extremely rare subtype of renal
      cell carcinoma most frequently characterized by a small, solitary, well-circumscribed,
      unencapsulated renal tumor composed of multiple small to medium-sized cysts
      with a white or gray, spongy ("bubble wrap-like") cut surface. Patients are
      usually asymptomatic or could manifest with abdominal pain, abdominal distension
      and/or hematuria. Progression, recurrence and metastasis rarely occur although
      lymph node, bone, pleura and liver metastases have been reported.
