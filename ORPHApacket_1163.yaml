- TextSection:
  - Contents: 'Aspergillosis is a rare infectious disease caused by inhalation of
      the opportunistic fungus <i>aspergillus</i> that can lead to the following manifestations:
      allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma, chronic necrotizing
      pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA), and invasive aspergillosis (IA). Aspergilloma
      occurs in patients with cavitary lung disease and results in a fungal mass with
      variable clinical presentations from asymptomatic to life-threatening (massive
      hemoptysis). CNPA manifests as subacute pneumonia in patients with underlying
      disease. IA is disseminated aspergillosis that eventually invades other organs.
      Cutaneous aspergillosis is usually the dermatological manifestation of IA that
      manifests as erythematous-to-violaceous plaques or papules, often characterized
      by a central necrotic ulcer or eschar.'
