- TextSection:
  - Contents: Combined pancreatic lipase-colipase deficiency is a disorder of lipid
      absorption and transport characterized by steatorrhea with foul-smelling stools
      from birth, diminished serum carotene and vitamin E and a combined deficiency
      of the pancreatic enzymes lipase and colipase. Patients are otherwise healthy
      and develop normally with no apparent pancreatic disease. There have been no
      further descriptions in the literature since 1990.
