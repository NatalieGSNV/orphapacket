Eisenmenger syndrome (see this term) is the most advanced form of PAH-CHD and is defined as the complete or partial reversal of an initial left-to-right shunt to a right-to-left shunt, causing cyanosis and limited exercise capacity. PAH-CHD also includes mild to moderate systemic-to-pulmonary shunts with no cyanosis at rest, patients with small defects, and those with residual PAH following corrective cardiac surgery."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"PAH associated with congenital heart disease"}]}]}]}
