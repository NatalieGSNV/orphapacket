- TextSection:
  - Contents: Congenital temporomandibular joint ankylosis is a rare maxillofacial
      disorder characterized by significant reduction in mouth opening (i.e. from
      a few millimeters to a few centimeters) in the absence of acquired factors (e.g.
      trauma, infection) contributing to the ankylosis. It is associated with variable
      degrees of facial dysmorphism (i.e. lateral deviation of the mandible and chin,
      lower facial asymmetry, retrognathia, micrognathia, dental malocclusion) and
      patients typically present with feeding and breathing difficulties. Developmental
      delay, hypotonia, seizures, and additional dysmorphic features (e.g. pectus
      excavatum, low-set ears, hypoplastic alae nasi) have also been reported.
