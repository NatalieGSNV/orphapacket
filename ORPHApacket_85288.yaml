  - Contents: X-linked intellectual disability, Stocco Dos Santos type is characterised
      by severe intellectual deficit with hyperactivity, language delay, congenital
      hip luxation, short stature, kyphosis and recurrent respiratory infections.
      Aggressive behaviour and frequent epileptic seizures may also be present. The
      syndrome has been described in four boys from the same family. Transmission
