- TextSection:
  - Contents: Cyclosporosis is a parasitic disease caused by <i>Cyclospora cayetanensis</i>,
      a recently discovered coccidia that was initially described in Peru and then
      in most intertropical zones. Infection occurs through ingestion of contaminated
      food or water and leads to abdominal pain, anorexia and diarrhoea, which may
      resolve spontaneously in immunocompetent individuals but may persist in a chronic
      form in immunocompromised subjects, leading to a decline in their general state
      of health.
