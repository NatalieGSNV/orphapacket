- TextSection:
  - Contents: Atresia of small intestine is a special form of intestinal atresia with
      absence of mesentery, which is most likely due to an intrauterine intestinal
      vascular accident. Newborns are usually preterm infants with low birth-weights,
      which may later worsened and the abdomen becomes progressively distended) as
      well as failure to thrive. Affected children present disrupted bowel loops assuming
      a spiral configuration resembling an 'apple peel' and may have less than half
      of the normal length of the small bowel and a physiologically short bowel. Atresia
      of small intestine is characterized by jejunal atresia near the ligament of
      Treitz, foreshortened bowel, and a large mesenteric gap. The bowel distal to
      the atresia is precariously supplied. Atresia of small intestine may be a manifestation
      of cystic fibrosis (see this term). The most important cause of mortality is
