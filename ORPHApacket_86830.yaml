- TextSection:
  - Contents: Chronic myeloproliferative disease, unclassifiable is a hematological
      neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid precursors in the
      bone marrow, blood and other tissues (spleen, liver), with clinical, morphological
      and molecular features of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), failing to meet
      criteria of a specific MPN. The presentation is nonspecific and variable and
      often includes leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and anemia. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly
      as well as fatigue, malaise or weight loss may appear in advanced stages.
