  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic optic nerve disorder characterized by visual impairment
      or blindness resulting from varying degrees of underdevelopment of the optic
      nerve or even complete absence of the optic nerve ganglion cells and central
      retinal vessels. It may be unilateral typically with otherwise normal brain
      development or bilateral with accompanying severe and widespread congenital
      malformations of the central nervous system.
