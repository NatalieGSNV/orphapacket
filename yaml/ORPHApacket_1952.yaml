    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: A rare disorder characterized by epiphyseal stippling and osteoclastic
      overactivity. It has been described in less than 10 patients but may be underdiagnosed.
      It is characterized radiographically by severe stippling of the lower spine
      and long bones and periosteal cloaking. Patients also have short metacarpals.
      The syndrome may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. This disorder
      should be included in the differential diagnosis of mucolipidosis type II. In
      order to make a definitive diagnosis lysosomal storage should be investigated
      by electron microscopy or enzyme assays should be performed. Familial recurrence
      can be easily detected by prenatal ultrasonography. This skeletal dysplasia
      is lethal.
