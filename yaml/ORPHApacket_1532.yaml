  TextSection:
    Contents: Lopez-Hernandez syndrome which may be classified among the neurocutaneous
      syndromes associates abnormalities of the cerebellum (rhombencephalosynapsis)
      cranial nerves (trigeminal anesthesia) and scalp (alopecia). It has been reported
      in 11 individuals so far. Other features observed in patients were craniosynostosis
      midfacial hypoplasia bilateral corneal opacities low-set ears short stature
      moderate intellectual impairment and ataxia. Hyperactivity depression self-injurious
      behaviour and bipolar disorder have also been reported.
