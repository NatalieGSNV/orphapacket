  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue sarcoma characterized by a high-grade lesion occurring
      almost exclusively in adults composed of bizarre polygonal round and spindle
      cells with evidence of skeletal muscle differentiation. Patients usually present
      with a rapidly growing painful mass located in the deep soft tissues of the
      extremities but also other anatomic regions. Prognosis is generally poor.
