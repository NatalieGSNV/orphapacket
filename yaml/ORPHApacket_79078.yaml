    Contents: IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialoadenitis (Mikulicz disease) is
      an IgG4-related sclerosing disease (see this term) characterized by persistent
      usually painless bilateral enlargement of the lacrimal parotid and submandibular
      glands associated with elevated levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 and with
      lymphocyte and IgG4-positive plasmacyte infiltration. It predominantly causes
      mouth and eye dryness but can also affect other organs such as the lungs liver
      and kidneys and be accompanied by complications such as autoimmune pancreatitis
      (AIP) retroperitoneal fibrosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis (see these terms).
