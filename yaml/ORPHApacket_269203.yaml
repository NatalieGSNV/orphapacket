    Contents: A rare congenital cerebellar malformation disorder characterized by
      complete or partial cerebellar vermis agenesis with no other associated malformations
      or anomalies. Patients may be asymptomatic although psychomotor delay hypotonia
      and incoordination are usually associated. Additional variable manifestations
      include intellectual disability oculomotor abnormalities (such as nystagmus
      impaired smooth pursuit impaired saccades strabismus ptosis and oculomotor apraxia)
      retinopathy abnormal visual evoked potentials ataxia episodic hyperpnea and
      delayed gait acquisition as well as delayed speech and language development.
