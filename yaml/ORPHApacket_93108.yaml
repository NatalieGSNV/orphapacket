  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare renal malformation in which the kidney(s) are present but their
      development is abnormal leading to malformation of histologic architecture of
      the kidney and presence of embryological tissue such as mesenchymal collarettes
      or other forms of undifferentiated and metaplastic tissues. Renal dysplasia
      can be unilateral or bilateral segmental and of variable severity.
