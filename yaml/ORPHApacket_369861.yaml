    Contents: Congenital sideroblastic anemia -B cell immunodeficiency- periodic fever-developmental
      delay syndrome is a form of constitutional sideroblastic anemia (see this term)
      characterized by severe microcytic anemia B-cell lymphopenia  panhypogammaglobulinemia
      and variable neurodegeneration. The disease presents in infancy with recurrent
      febrile illnesses gastrointestinal disturbances developmental delay seizures
      ataxia and sensorineural deafness. Most patients require regular blood transfusion
      iron chelation and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement. Stem cell
      transplantation has been reported to be successful.
