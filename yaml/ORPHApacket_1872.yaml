    Contents: A rare genetic isolated inherited retinal disorder characterized by
      primary cone degeneration with significant secondary rod involvement with a
      variable fundus appearance. Typical presentation includes decreased visual acuity
      central scotoma photophobia color vision alteration followed by night blindness
      and loss of peripheral visual field.
