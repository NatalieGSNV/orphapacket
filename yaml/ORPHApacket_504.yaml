  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare cutaneous myiasis characterized by infestation of humans by the
      larvae of horse or cattle bot flies. After penetration of the skin horse bot
      fly larvae form tunnels in the lower layers of the epidermis where they can
      migrate for up to several months causing serpentine erythematous lesions with
      intense pruritus. Cattle bot fly larvae penetrate deeper into the subcutaneous
      tissue producing more painful erythematous lesions which usually resolve after
      several hours or days when the larvae move on to infest another area.
