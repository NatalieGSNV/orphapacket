  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare bacterial infectious disease characterized by invasive infection
      with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) typically after VRE colonization
      of the gastrointestinal tract or the skin in healthcare settings. Invasive infection
      most commonly occurs in immunocompromised individuals and patients with breaches
      in normal defensive barriers (such as intravascular lines or urinary catheters).
      Patients may develop urinary tract infection bacteremia and endocarditis as
      well as infections of the abdomen pelvis biliary tract and wounds. Less frequent
      infection sites include the bone joints and meninges among others.
