  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital anomaly of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in
      which one or both kidneys (unilateral or bilateral MCDK respectively) are large
      distended by multiple cysts and non-functional. Unilateral MCDK is typically
      asymptomatic if the other kidney is fully functional but may occasionally present
      with abdominal obstructive signs when the cysts become too large. Bilateral
      MCDK is considered a lethal entity and neonates present with features of the
      Potter sequence severe pulmonary hypoplasia and severe renal failure and generally
      die shortly after birth.
