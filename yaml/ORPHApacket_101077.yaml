    Contents: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 3 is a rare genetic peripheral
      sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern
      and the childhood- to adolescent-onset of progressive distal muscle weakness
      and atrophy (beginning in the lower extremities and then affecting the upper
      extremities) as well as distal pansensory loss in the upper and lower extremities
      pes cavus and absent or reduced distal tendon reflexes. Pain and paresthesia
      are frequently the initial sensory symptoms. Spastic paraparesis (manifested
      by clasp-knife sign hyperactive deep-tendon reflexes and Babinski sign) has
      also been reported.
