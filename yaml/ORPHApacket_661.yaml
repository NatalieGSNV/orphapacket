    Contents: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disease
      due to a severely impaired central autonomic control of breathing and dysfunction
      of the autonomous nervous system. The incidence is estimated to be at 1 of 200
      000 livebirths. A heterozygous mutation of <i>PHOX-2B</i> gene is found in 90%
      of the patients. Association with a Hirschsprung's disease is observed in 16%
      of the cases. Despite a high mortality rate and a lifelong dependence to mechanical
      ventilation the long-term outcome of CCHS should be ultimately improved by multidisciplinary
      and coordinated follow-up of the patients.
