  TextSection:
    Contents: Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma is a rare indolent subtype
      of clear cell renal carcinoma arising from epithelial cells in the renal cortex.
      It most frequently manifests with a well-circumscribed well-encapsulated unicentric
      unilateral small tumor that typically does not metastasize. Clinically it can
      present with flank or abdominal pain or hematuria although most patients are
      usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Bilateral and/or multifocal presentation
      should raise the suspicion of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
