    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: Okihiro syndrome is a syndrome of multiple congenital anomalies and
      is characterized by ocular manifestations (uni- or bilateral Duane anomaly (95%
      of cases) congenital optic nerve hypoplasia or optic disc coloboma) bilateral
      deafness and radial ray malformation that can include thenar hypoplasia and/or
      hypoplasia or aplasia of the thumbs; hypoplasia or aplasia of the radii; shortening
      and radial deviation of the forearms; triphalangeal thumbs; and duplication
      of the thumb (preaxial polydactyly).The phenotype overlaps with other <i>SALL4>/i>
      related disorders including acro-renal-ocular syndrome and Holt-Oram syndrome
      (see these terms). Transmission is autosomal dominant.
