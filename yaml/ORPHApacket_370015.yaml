    Contents: Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Isidor type is rare primary bone dysplasia
      disorder characterized by normal birth length with early postnatal growth deficiency
      resulting in severe disproportionate short stature (with short trunk and limbs)
      severe genum varum flexion contractures in the hips and lumbar hyperlordosis.
      Radiological findings reveal platyspondyly with central indentation of vertebral
      endplates progressive and severe epimetaphyseal abnormalities that primarily
      affect the lower limbs and include very small irregular proximal femoral and
      knee epiphyses severe coxa vara delayed ossification of proximal femoral epiphyses
      and irregular distal femoral and proximal tibial metaphyses.
