  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ophthalmic disorder characterized by a non-infectious uveitis
      potentially involving all parts of the uveal tract and due to a paraneoplastic
      autoimmune reaction. The signs and symptoms usually precede the tumor diagnosis
      and may include ocular redness and pain light sensitivity blurred vision floaters
      and decreased vision. The most classic form is the intermediate uveitis associated
      with anti-CV2 antibodies in small-cell lung cancer or other neoplasms. Other
      ocular and/or extra-ocular manifestations are commonly present in addition.
