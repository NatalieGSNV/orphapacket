  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic anomaly disorder
      characterized by a t(8;21)(q22;q22) balanced translocation cytogenetic abnormality
      forming a RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene presenting with morphological characteristics
      which include myeloblasts with indented nuclei basophilic cytoplasm with a prominent
      paranuclear hof that may contain a few azurophilic granules prominent and possibly
      large promyelocytes myelocytes and metamyelocytes easily identifiable Auer rods
      and more variably bone marrow eosinophilia. Myeloid sarcoma is frequently present
      at diagnosis. Detection of the t(8;21)(q22;22) translocation is sufficient for
      diagnosis irrespective of blast count.
