  TextSection:
    Contents: COG7-CDG is a congenital disorder of glycosylation characterised by
      dysmorphism skeletal dysplasia hypotonia hepatosplenomegaly jaundice cardiac
      insufficiency recurrent infections and epilepsy. To date it has been described
      in two infants both of whom died within the first three months of life. The
      syndrome is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding COG-7 (chromosome 16)
      a subunit of the oligomeric Golgi complex.
