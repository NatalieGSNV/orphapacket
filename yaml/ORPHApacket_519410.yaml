  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of the anterior segment of the eye characterized by
      slowly progressive bilateral asymmetric usually non-inflammatory degeneration
      of the peripheral cornea resulting in stromal thinning vascularization lipid
      deposition and against-the-rule astigmatism with decreased visual acuity. Degeneration
      typically involves the superior aspect of the cornea first and extends circumferentially
      leading to circumferential ectasia of the peripheral cornea. Opacification of
      the central cornea may occur at a very advanced stage. In rare cases the condition
      is complicated by perforation.
