  TextSection:
    Contents: A fetopathy that is likely to occur when a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infected
      pregnant woman transmits the virus <i>in utero</i>. Children born with congenital
      CMV infection may present with hepatomegaly splenomegaly jaundice pneumonitis
      fetal growth retardation petechiae purpura and thrombocytopenia. Congenital
      CMV infection can equally result in major neurological sequelae including microcephaly
      intracranial calcifications sensorineural hearing loss chorioretinitis intellectual
      and motor disabilities and seizure disorders. CMV disease sequelae caused by
      a primary infection are usually more severe than those caused by the reactivation
      of a latent infection.
