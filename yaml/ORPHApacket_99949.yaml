  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C) is a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      type 4 characterized by childhood or adolescent-onset of a relatively mild demyelinating
      sensorimotor neuropathy that contrasts with a severe rapidly progressing early-onset
      scoliosis and the typical CMT phenotype (i.e. distal muscle weakness and atrophy
      sensory loss and often foot deformity). A wide spectrum of nerve conduction
      velocities are observed and cranial nerve involvement and kyphoscoliosis have
      also been reported.
