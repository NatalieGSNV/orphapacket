  TextSection:
    Contents: Immunodeficiency with factor H anomaly is a rare genetic primary immunodeficiency
      disease characterized by increased susceptibility to recurrent usually severe
      infections (particularly by <i> Neisseria meningitidis</i> <i>Escherichia coli</i>
      and <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>) renal impairment and/or autoimmune diseases
      typically manifesting with otitis media bronchitis meningitis and/or septicemia
      as well as hematuria/proteinuria asthma nephrotic syndrome hemolytic uremic
      syndrome glomerulonephritis and/or systemic lupus erythematosus. Laboratory
      serum analysis reveals in addition to factor H deficiency decreased complement
      factor B properdin complement C3 and terminal complement components.
