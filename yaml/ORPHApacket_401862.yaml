  TextSection:
    Contents: Lipoyl transferase 1 deficiency is a very rare inborn error of metabolism
      disorder with a highly variable phenotype typically characterized by neonatal
      to infancy-onset of seizures psychomotor delay and abnormal muscle tone that
      may include hypo- and/or hypertonia resulting in generalized weakness dystonic
      movements and/or progressive respiratory distress associated with severe lactic
      acidosis and elevated lactate ketoglutarate and 2-oxoacids in urine. Additional
      manifestations may include dehydration vomiting signs of liver dysfunction extrapyramidal
      signs spastic tetraparesis brisk deep tendon reflexes speech impairment swallowing
      difficulties and pulmonary hypertension.
