  TextSection:
    Contents: Panniculitis-induced localized lipodystrophy is a rare acquired localized
      lipodystrophy disorder characterized by eruption of tender occasionally painful
      erythematous nodules and plaques which enlarge radially and resolve into lipoatrophic
      lesions often located in the upper and lower limbs. Histologically lesions are
      characterized by lipophagic lobular panniculitis and absence of vasculitis.
