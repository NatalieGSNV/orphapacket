    Contents: 46,XY partial gonadal dysgenesis (46,XY PGD) is a disorder of sex development
      (DSD) associated with anomalies in gonadal development that results in genital
      ambiguity of variable degree ranging from almost female phenotype to almost
      male phenotype in a patient carrying a male 46,XY karyotype.
