  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with sensorineural deafness
      is a rare genetic coenzyme Q10 deficiency characterized by sensorineural deafness
      and severe progressive nephrotic syndrome not responding to steroid treatment.
      Clinical manifestations include early onset proteinuria hypoalbuminemia and
      edema leading to end-stage renal disease. The renal biopsy reveals focal segmental
      glomerulosclerosis and diffuse mesangial sclerosis. Rarely seizures ataxia and
      dysmorphic features have been described.
