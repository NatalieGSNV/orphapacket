    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: This syndrome is characterised by total or partial anosmia at birth.
      So far 15 patients have been described. The anosmia is caused by a defect in
      the development of the olfactory bulbs or by replacement of the olfactory epithelium
      by respiratory epithelium. The mode of transmission appears to be autosomal
      dominant with incomplete penetrance. Isolated congenital anosmia is found in
      some parents of individuals with Kallman syndrome (see this term).
