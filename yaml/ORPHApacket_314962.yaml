    Contents: A rare hypereosinophilic syndrome characterized by hypereosinophilia
      produced by reactive/non-clonal eosinophils secondary to an underlying medical
      condition and persisting for at least six months. The disorder can derive from
      non-neoplastic conditions (such as chronic infections and infestations allergic
      reactions intoxications or autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders) or
      from neoplasms including non-myeloid malignancies among others. It is associated
      with signs of organ infiltration dysfunction and damage. Clinical manifestations
      are highly variable depending on the organ systems involved and most commonly
      include dermatologic pulmonary cardiac gastrointestinal and cerebral manifestations.
