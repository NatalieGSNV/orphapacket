  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG) is a rare genetic
      central nervous system malformation disorder characterized in males by lissencephaly
      (with posterior predominance and moderately thickened cortex) complete absence
      of corpus callosum neonatal-onset (mainly perinatal) intractable seizures postnatal
      microcephaly severe hypotonia poor responsiveness and hypogonadism (micropenis
      hypospadias cryptorchidism small scrotal sac). Defective temperature regulation
      and chronic diarrhea may be additionally observed.
