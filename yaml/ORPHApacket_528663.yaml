  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-histaminic angioedema characterized by potentially life-threatening
      episodes of edema of subcutaneous and/or mucosal tissues without urticaria caused
      by excessive consumption of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) in the context of
      lymphoproliferative or autoimmune diseases. Patients typically present in the
      fourth decade of life or later and without a family history of angioedema. Clinical
      manifestation includes nonpitting edema of the skin predominantly involving
      the face but also the limbs or genitals as well as abdominal pain due to involvement
      of the gastrointestinal mucosa and severe edema of the upper airway and oral
      mucosa. Laboratory examination shows low C1-INH activity and low C3 C4 and C1q
      levels. Autoantibodies to C1-INH are frequently detectable.
