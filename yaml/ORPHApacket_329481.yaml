  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic renal disease characterized by the formation of intraglomerular
      lipoprotein thrombi due to lipid deposition in severely dilated glomerular capillaries.
      Laboratory examination reveals abnormal serum lipid profiles in particular markedly
      elevated apolipoprotein E. Clinical manifestations include proteinuria or nephrotic
      syndrome with hypertension and potential progression to chronic renal failure.
      Systemic complications of dyslipidemia are not observed.
