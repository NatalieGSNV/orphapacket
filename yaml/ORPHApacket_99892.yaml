  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) caused by abnormal production
      of ACTH due in 80% of cases to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) oversecretion
      by a pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease CD) and in 20% of cases to ectopic ACTH
      secretion (CS due to EAS) by an extrapituitary tumor (in 50% of cases originating
      in the lungs or less commonly in the thymus pancreas adrenal gland or thyroid)
      or very rarely due to a tumor secreting both ACTH and corticotrophin-releasing
      hormone (CRH).
