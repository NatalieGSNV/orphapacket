  TextSection:
    Contents: Renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (RCAD) is a rare form of maturity-onset
      diabetes of the young (MODY; see this term) characterized clinically by heterogeneous
      cystic renal disease and early-onset familial non-autoimmune diabetes. Pancreatic
      atrophy liver dysfunction and genital tract anomalies are also features of the
      syndrome.
