    Contents: Lymphoepithelial-like carcinoma is a rare malignant epithelial tumor
      composed of undifferentiated epithelial cells with dense lymphoid stroma mimicking
      lymphoepithelioma. It often shows association with Epstein-Barr virus infection
      and can develop in various organs such as the nasopharynx stomach skin breast
      and lungs among others. The presenting symptoms as well as the radiologic features
      are usually nonspecific and depend on the affected site and organ.
