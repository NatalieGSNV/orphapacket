  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous
      origin and course of the left coronary artery which originates from the right
      aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course which may be intramural
      prepulmonic subpulmonic retroaortic retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex.
      Patients are frequently asymptomatic although chest pain dyspnea palpitations
      dizziness syncope and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense
      physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a high
      risk of sudden cardiac death so surgical revascularization is recommended even
      in cases with no associated evidence of myocardial ischemia.
