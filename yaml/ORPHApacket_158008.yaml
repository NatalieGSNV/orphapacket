  TextSection:
    Contents: Papular xanthoma is a form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized
      by cutaneous presentation of solitary or disseminated yellow to orange-brown
      papular or papulonodular noncoalescent asymptomatic skin lesions located predominantly
      on the head neck trunk and extremities (rarely on oral mucosa) in the presence
      of normolipidemia. Microscopically the lesions consist of monomorphous infiltrate
      of xanthomatized macrophages and numerous Touton giant cells with scant or absent
      inflammatory infiltrate. It is usually not associated with systemic disease.
