  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism characterized
      by the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA) and its oxidized product benzoquinone
      acetic acid (BQA) in various tissues (e.g. cartilage connective tissue) and
      body fluids (urine sweat) causing urine to darken when exposed to air as well
      as grey-blue coloration of the sclera and ear helix (ochronosis) and a disabling
      joint disease involving both the axial and peripheral joints (ochronotic arthropathy).
