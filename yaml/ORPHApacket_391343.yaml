  TextSection:
    Contents: Fatal post-viral neurodegenerative disorder is a rare neuroinflammatory
      disease characterized by the onset of ataxia dysarthia and cerebral white matter
      changes which are triggered by viral infection. Episodic progressive neurodegeneration
      (manifesting with loss of motor and verbal skills muscle weakness further cerebral
      white matter degeneration and eventually death) is observed in the absence of
      hematopathology cytokine overproduction fever hypertrigliceridemia hypofibrinogenemia
      and hyperferritinemia.
