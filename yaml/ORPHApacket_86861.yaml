    Contents: A rare secondary glomerular disease characterized by proteinuria dysproteinemias
      nephrotic syndrome and nodular glomerulopathy leading to renal failure with
      or without extra-renal manifestations. The renal biopsy shows typical deposits
      of monoclonal immunoglobulins that do not show a fibrillar organization and
      are negative for Congo red staining. Associated signs and symptoms depend on
      the involvement of other organs liver heart nerve fibers gastrointestinal tract
