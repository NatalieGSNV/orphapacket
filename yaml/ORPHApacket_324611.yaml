    Contents: A rare form of axonal peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterized
      by classical CMT2 signs and symptoms (progressive weakness and atrophy of distal
      limb muscles mild sensory deficits of position vibration and pain/temperature
      pes cavus and symmetrically absent or reduced muscle and sensory action potentials
      with relatively preserved nerve conduction velocities in neurophysiological
      studies) as well as pyramidal tract involvement (spasticity hyperreflexia).
