    Contents: IMAGe syndrome is characterized by the association of <i>I</i>ntrauterine
      growth retardation <i>M</i>etaphyseal dysplasia (and short limbs) <i>A</i>drenal
      hypoplasia congenita and <i>Ge</i>nital anomalies. It has been described in
      less than 20 cases. The patients also present with dysmorphic features (frontal
      bossing broad nasal bridge low-set ears). In boys genital anomalies include
      bilateral cryptorchidism hypospadias micropenis and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
      This syndrome is likely to be transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.
