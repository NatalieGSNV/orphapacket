  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare functioning neuroendocrine tumor of pancreas characterized by
      a typically well-differentiated neoplasm composed of cells expressing serotonin.
      Patients may present with atypical carcinoid syndrome with abdominal pain diarrhea
      weight loss and/or flushing. Carcinoid syndrome is usually present only when
      there are liver metastases. The tumors tend to be larger than non-functioning
      tumors and are associated with a poorer prognosis because they are almost always
      metastatic.
