  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of spina bifida cystica (saccular open neural tube defect
      (NTD)) characterized by a non-neurulated spinal cord (neural placode) on the
      surface of the cystic extension of dysplastic meninges (non-epidermised posterior
      meningocele). The spinal cord extends through a spina bifida (posterior vertebral
      defect) with typically everted or parallel laminae. Nerve roots are connected
      to the borders of the neural placode and are visible inside the sac. Myelomeningocele
      is characteristically associated with a Chiari II malformation. It can be either
      isolated or associated with split cord malformation.
