  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neural tube defect characterized by cystic dilatation of the
      central canal of the spinal cord herniating posteriorly through a dorsal spinal
      defect. The malformation can occur anywhere along the spinal cord but appears
      to be more frequent in the posterior cervical and the lumbosacral region. It
      may be an isolated anomaly or be associated with other defects including anorectal
      and genitourinary anomalies or sacral agenesis.
