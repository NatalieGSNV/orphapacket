    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: Crigler-Najjar syndrome (CNS) is a hereditary disorder of bilirubin
      metabolism characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to a hepatic
      deficit of bilirubin glucuronosyltransferase (GT) activity. Two types have been
      described CNS types 1 and 2 (see these terms). CNS1 is characterized by a complete
      deficit of the enzyme and is unaffected by phenobarbital induction therapy whereas
      the enzymatic deficit is partial and responds to phenobarbital in CNS2.
