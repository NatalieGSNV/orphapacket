  TextSection:
    Contents: Caudal regression-sirenomelia spectrum is a group of rare genetic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis disorders characterized by varying degrees of caudal
      abdomen pelvic renal anorectal urogenital and/or lumbosacral spine malformations
      with or without lower limb fusion. Phenotype is highly variable ranging from
      minor forms with isolated coccygeal agenesis to severe forms presenting with
      a single rudimentary limb. Central nervous system anomalies have also been reported.
