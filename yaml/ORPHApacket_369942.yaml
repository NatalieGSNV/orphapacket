  TextSection:
    Contents: CADDS is a rare genetic neurometabolic disease characterized by severe
      intrauterine growth retardation failure to thrive profound neonatal hypotonia
      severe global development delay elevated very long chain fatty acids in plasma
      and neonatal cholestasis leading to hepatic failure and death. Other features
      include ocular abnormalities (e.g. blindness and cataracts) sensorineural deafness
      seizures and abnormal brain morphology (notably delayed CNS myelination and
      ventriculomegaly).
