    Contents: A rare genetic persistent combined dystonia characterized by clinical
      signs similar to ataxia-telangiectasia but with a later (usually adulthood)
      onset and slower progression. Patients typically present extrapyramidal signs
      such as resting tremor choreathetosis and dystonia as the initial symptoms and
      later often develop mild cerebellar ataxia (with gait usually preserved). Telangiectasia
      and immunodeficiency may be absent but secondary features of ataxia-telangiectasia
      such as risk of malignancy dysarthria and peripheral neuropathy are frequently
      present.
