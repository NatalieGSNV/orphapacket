  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary lymphedema characterized by a highly variable lymphatic
      phenotype ranging from severe lymphatic-related hydrops fetalis which may cause
      perinatal demise or fully resolve to become completely asymptomatic to a mild
      presentation in older patients with persistent varicose veins peripheral edema
      and impaired lymph drainage in the lower limbs. Atrial septal defect has been
      described in association and may be the only anomaly in some patients.
