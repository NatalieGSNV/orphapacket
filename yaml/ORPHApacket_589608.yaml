  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by linear hypopigmentation
      and hypotrichosis following the lines of Blaschko symmetric or asymmetric facial
      dysmorphism and body asymmetry in association with ocular dental and acral anomalies.
      Reported manifestations include microphthalmia strabismus myopia oligodontia
      microdontia conical teeth abnormal enamel brachydactyly syndactyly and broad
      first toe as well as dysmorphic facial features such as downslanting palpebral
      fissures broad nasal bridge malar hypoplasia and microstomia. Brain imaging
      may show cystic leukoencephalopathy and ventricular dilation.
