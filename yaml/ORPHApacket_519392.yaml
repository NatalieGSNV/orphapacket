  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of the anterior segment of the eye characterized by
      spontaneous separation of the anterior layer of the iris stroma from the posterior
      stroma and muscle layers. The anterior layer then splits into strands and the
      free ends float freely in the anterior chamber. The condition usually affects
      patients in the seventh decade of life and is often associated with glaucoma.
      It may begin on one side but is typically a bilateral disease. The inferior
      part of the iris is most commonly involved.
