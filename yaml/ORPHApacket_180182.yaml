    Contents: A rare breast malformation characterized by the presence of accessory
      breasts with a complete ductal system areola and nipple in addition to two normal
      breasts. The accessory breast tissue mostly lies along the milk lines. It is
      often not recognized until puberty when it begins to respond to regular hormonal
      fluctuations and may develop the same changes as normal breasts throughout life.
