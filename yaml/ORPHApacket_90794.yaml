    Contents: A disorder that is the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
      (CAH) characterized by simple virilizing or salt wasting forms that can manifest
      with genital ambiguity in females and with adrenal insufficiency (in both sexes)
      and that presents with dehydration hypoglycemia in the neonatal period (that
      can be lethal if untreated) and hyperandrogenia.
