  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive proximal renal tubular acidosis (AR pRTA) is a rare
      form of proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA; see this term) characterized
      by an isolated defect in the proximal tubule leading to the decreased reabsorption
      of bicarbonate and consequentially to urinary bicarbonate wastage along with
      additional characteristic clinical features.
