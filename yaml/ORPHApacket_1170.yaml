  TextSection:
    Contents: 'The disorders involving primarily the cerebellar parenchyma have been
      classified into six forms. In cerebelloparenchymal disorder III cerebellar ataxia
      is congenital (non-progressive) and characterized by cerebellar symptoms such
      as incoordination of gait often associated with poor coordination of hands speech
      and eye movements. The other features are congenital mental retardation and
      hypotonia in addition to other neurological and non-neurological features. MRI
      or CT scan show marked atrophy of the vermis and hemispheres. A severe loss
      of granule cells with heterotopic Purkinje cells is observed. The mode of inheritance
      in the few reported families is autosomal recessive. In one family cerebellar
      ataxia was associated to albinism.: In a large inbred Lebanese family the disease
      locus was assigned to a 12.1-cM interval on chromosome 9q34-qter between markers
      D9S67 and D9S312. The primary biochemical defect remains unknown. Up to now
      the only treatment has consisted in early interventional therapies including
      intensive speech therapy and adequate stimulation and/or training.'
