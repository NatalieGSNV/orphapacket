  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer characterized by the
      development of cutaneous sebaceous neoplasia and at least one visceral malignancy
      most frequently gastrointestinal carcinoma. The malignancies are usually multiple
      occur at an early age but tend to be of low-grade and have a relatively low
      incidence of metastases. Sebaceous tumors are usually multiple with sebaceous
      adenomas being the commonest. Multiple keratoacanthomas usually located on the
      face or the trunk have been reported as a feature. Cutaneous tumors may precede
      or follow the first presentation of internal malignancy which usually involves
      the gastrointestinal tract the breast or the genitourinary tract.
