    Contents: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1) also known as Norman's disease
      is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders
      with a prenatal onset characterized by diffuse muscular atrophy secondary to
      pontocerebellar hypoplasia and spinal cord anterior horn cell degeneration resulting
      in early death.
