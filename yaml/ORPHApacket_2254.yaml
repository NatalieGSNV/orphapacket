    Contents: A severe genetic form of pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) characterized
      by spinal cord anterior horn cell degeneration in addition to pontocerebellar
      hypoplasia. Clinically patients manifest with a severe global development deficit
      that is evident early on from difficulties in feeding and swallowing
