  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome with a probable
      autosomal dominant inheritance characterized by a progressively coarse acromegaloid-like
      facial appearance with thickening of the lips and intraoral mucosa large and
      doughy hands and in some cases developmental delay. AFA syndrome appears to
      be part of a phenotypic spectrum that includes hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia
      Cantu type and hypertrichosis-acromegaloid facial appearance syndrome.
