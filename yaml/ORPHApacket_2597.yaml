    Contents: Mitochondrial myopathy-lactic acidosis-deafness is a type of metabolic
      myopathy described only in two sisters to date presenting during childhood and
      characterized clinically by growth failure severe muscle weakness and moderate
      sensorineural deafness and biochemically by metabolic acidosis elevated serum
      pyruvate concentration hyperalaninemia and hyperalaninuria. There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1973.
