  TextSection:
    Contents: Nasal glial heterotopia is a rare developmental abnormality presenting
      usually at birth or in early childhood (rarely in adulthood) as a benign non-pulsatile
      mass that can lead to nasal obstruction deformation of the septum and nasal
      bone and respiratory distress if untreated. Nasal glial heterotopias have no
      communication with the central nervous system; however an associated defect
      in the cribriform plate is sometimes reported.
