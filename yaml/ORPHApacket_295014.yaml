    Contents: Familial isolated clinodactyly of fingers is a rare genetic non-syndromic
      congenital limb malformation disorder characterized by angulation of a digit
      in the radio-ulnar (coronal) plane away from the axis of joint flexion-extension
      in several members of a single family with no other associated manifestations.
      Deviation is usually bilateral and commonly involves the fifth finger. Affected
      digits present trapezoidal or delta-shaped phalanges on imaging.
