  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant distal hereditary motor neuropathy characterized
      by onset of slowly progressive distal limb weakness and atrophy between the
      second and fifth decades of life. Sensory involvement is typically less pronounced
      or absent. The severity of the condition is variable and both lower and upper
      extremities may be involved.
