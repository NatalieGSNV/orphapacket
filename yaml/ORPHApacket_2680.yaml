  TextSection:
    Contents: Hypomyelination neuropathy-arthrogryposis syndrome is a rare genetic
      limb malformation syndrome characterized by multiple congenital distal joint
      contractures (incl. talipes equinovarus and both proximal and distal interphalangeal
      joint contractures of the hands) and very severe motor paralysis at birth (i.e.
      lack of swallowing autonomous respiratory function and deep tendon reflexes)
      leading to death within first 3 months of life. Fetal hypo- or akinesia late-onset
      polyhydramnios and dramatically reduced or absent motor nerve conduction velocities
      (<10 m/s) are frequently associated. Nerve ultrastructural morphology shows
      severe abnormalities of the nodes of Ranvier and myelinated axons.
