  TextSection:
    Contents: Spondylocostal dysostosis-anal and genitourinary malformations syndrome
      is characterised by the association of spondylocostal dysostosis with anal and
      genitourinary malformations (anal atresia and agenesis of external and internal
      genitalia). To date only four cases have been described in the literature. Autosomal
      recessive inheritance has been suggested.
