    Contents: A rare distal hereditary motor neuropathy with a variable clinical phenotype
      typically characterized by congenital non-progressive predominantly distal lower
      limb muscle weakness and atrophy and congenital (or early-onset) flexion contractures
      of the hip knee and ankle joints. Reduced or absent lower limb deep tendon reflexes
      skeletal anomalies (bilateral talipes equinovarus scoliosis kyphoscoliosis lumbar
      hyperlordisis) late ambulation waddling gait joint hyperlaxity and/or bladder
      and bowel dysfuntion are usually also associated.
