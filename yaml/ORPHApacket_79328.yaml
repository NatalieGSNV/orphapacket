  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation characterized
      by progressive microcephaly hypotonia developmental delay drug-resistant infantile
      epilepsy and hepatomegaly. Additional features that may be observed include
      failure to thrive pericardial effusion renal cysts skeletal dysplasia facial
      dysmorphism (frontal bossing hypertelorism depressed nasal bridge low-seated
      ears large mouth) and hydrops fetalis. The disease is caused by loss-of-function
      mutations in the gene <i>ALG9</i> (11q23).
