  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic pituitary disease characterized by variable deficiency
      of all hormones produced in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Clinical
      manifestations include hypothyroidism hypogonadism growth retardation and short
      stature and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Age of onset is variable. Signs
      and symptoms usually develop gradually and loss of the different hormones is
      often sequential.
