    Contents: Lethal omphalocele-cleft palate syndrome is characterized by the association
      of omphalocele and cleft palate. It has been described in three daughters of
      normal unrelated parents. They were all diagnosed at birth. One had omphalocele
      posterior cleft palate and uterus bicornuatus; she died at 2 months. The second
      had omphalocele cleft uvula and hydrocephalus and died at 4 months; the third
      had omphalocele and cleft palate and died at 1 year. This syndrome is likely
      to be inherited as an autosomal recessive condition.
