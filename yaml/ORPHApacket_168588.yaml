  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic endocrine disease characterized by defect in conversion
      of cortisone to active cortisol resulting in ACTH-mediated excessive androgen
      release from adrenal glands. Premature adrenarche is typical with precocious
      pseudopuberty proportionate tall stature and accelerated bone maturation in
      males and hirsutism oligoamenorrhea central obesity and infertility in females.
      Imaging studies may indicate adrenal hyperplasia.
