    Contents: Hypoplastic pancreas-intestinal atresia-hypoplastic gallbladder syndrome
      is a rare potentially fatal genetic visceral malformation syndrome characterized
      by neonatal diabetes hypoplastic or annular pancreas duodenal and jejunal atresia
      as well as gallbladder aplasia or hypoplasia. Patients typically present intrauterine
