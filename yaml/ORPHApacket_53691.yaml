  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare developmental defect of the eye characterized by usually bilateral
      absence of the normal protrusion of the cornea from the sclera the corneal curvature
      being the same as that of the adjacent sclera. Most patients develop hyperopia
      hazy corneal limbus and arcus lipoides at an early age. The condition may present
      as an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive form with the latter showing
      more severe signs and symptoms (such as a round and opaque thickening located
      centrally in the cornea) and more frequent association with other ocular anomalies.
