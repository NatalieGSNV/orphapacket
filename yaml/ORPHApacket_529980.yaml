    Contents: A rare genetic immune disease characterized by recurrent sinopulmonary
      infections and autoimmune enterocolopathy manifesting as frequent episodes of
      intractable diarrhea with abdominal pain and fever accompanied by eczematous
      rashes due to deficits in components of innate and adaptive immunity. Immunologic
      abnormalities include IgG subclass deficiency impaired antigen-induced lymphocyte
      proliferation reduced cytokine production by CD8+ T lymphocytes and decreased
      numbers of natural killer cells.
