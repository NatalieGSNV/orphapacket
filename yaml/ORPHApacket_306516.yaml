  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Familial primary hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis
      (FHHNC) is a form of familial primary hypomagnesemia (FPH see this term) characterized
      by renal magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) wasting nephrocalcinosis kidney failure
      and in some cases severe ocular impairment. Two subtypes of FHHNC are described:
      FHHNC with severe ocular involvement (FHHNCOI) and without severe ocular involvement
      (FHHN) (see these terms).'
