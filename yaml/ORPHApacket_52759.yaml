  TextSection:
    Contents: "Vasculitis represents a clinically heterogenous group of diseases of\
      \ multifactorial etiology characterized by inflammation of either large-sized\
      \ vessels (large-vessel vasculitis e.g. Giant-cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis;\
      \ see these terms) medium-sized vessels (medium-vessel vasculitis e.g. polyarteritis\
      \ nodosa and Kawasaki disease; see these terms) or small-sized vessels (small-vessel\
      \ vasculitis e.g. granulomatosis with polyangiitis microscopic polyangiitis\
      \ immunoglobulin A vasculitis and cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis; see these\
      \ terms). Vasculitis occurs at any age may be acute or chronic and manifests\
      \ with general symptoms such as fever weight loss and fatigue as well as more\
      \ specific clinical signs depending on the type of vessels and organs affected.\
      \ The degree of severity is variable ranging from life or sight threatening\
      \ disease (e.g. Beh\xE7et disease see this term) to relatively minor skin disease."
