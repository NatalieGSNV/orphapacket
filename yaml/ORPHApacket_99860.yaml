  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by infiltration of
      bone marrow and peripheral blood by small to medium-sized blast cells typically
      positive for the B-cell markers CD19 cCD79a and cCD22. Predilection sites for
      extramedullary involvement are the central nervous system lymph nodes spleen
      liver and testes. Patients present with evidence of bone marrow failure (i.
      e. thrombocytopenia anemia and/or neutropenia) and variable leukocyte count
      as well as lymphadenopathy hepatomegaly splenomegaly bone pain and arthralgias.
