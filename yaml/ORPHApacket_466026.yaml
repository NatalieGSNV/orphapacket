    Contents: A rare constitutional hemolytic anemia characterized in symptomatic
      forms by mild to severe chronic hemolysis which is further exacerbated by oxidative
      stress and may lead to chronic non-sperocytic hemolytic anemia of variable severity.
      Variation in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels accounts for differences
      in sensitivity to oxidants with chronic hemolysis occurring in association with
      very low enzyme levels while the majority of affected individuals remain asymptomatic.
      The most common clinical manifestations are neonatal jaundice and signs and
      symptoms of acute hemolysis (such as fatigue back pain anemia and jaundice).
