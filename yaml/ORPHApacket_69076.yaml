  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic glucose transport disorder characterized by the presence
      of persistent isolated glucosuria in the absence of both proximal tubular dysfunction
      and hyperglycemia. The disorder is benign in the majority of cases although
      it may occasionally manifest with polyuria enuresis a mild growth and pubertal
      maturation delay hypercalciuria aminoaciduria and in severe cases increased
      incidence of urinary infections and episodic dehydration and ketosis during
      pregnancy and starvation.
