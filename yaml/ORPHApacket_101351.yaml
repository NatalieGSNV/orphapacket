  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial isolated congenital asplenia is a rare non-syndromic potentially
      life-threatening visceral malformation characterized by the absence of normal
      spleen function resulting in a primary immunodeficiency. Typically the condition
      manifests with severe recurrent overwhelming infections (especially pneumococcal
      sepsis) in otherwise apparently healthy infants. In adults with no history of
      severe sepsis in infancy thrombocytosis may be the presenting sign. Howell-Jolly
      bodies on blood smears and an absent spleen on abdominal ultrasound examination
      are highly suggestive associated findings.
