      after the age of 2 and affecting the hair of the scalp or very rarely beard
      axillary or pubic hair that is characterized by a banded or speckled appearance
      due to alternating light bands (corresponding to air-filled cavities within
      the cortex of the affected hair shafts) and dark bands. The bands have a lifelong
