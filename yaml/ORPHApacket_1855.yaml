    Contents: Spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD) is a very rare genetic skeletal
      dysplasia characterized clinically by skeletal anomalies (short stature platyspondyly
      short broad ilia) and enchondromas in the long bones or pelvis. SPENCD may have
      a heterogeneous clinical spectrum with neurological involvement (spasticity
      mental retardation and cerebral calcifications) or autoimmune manifestations
      such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura systemic lupus erythematosus (see these
      terms) hemolytic anemia and thyroiditis.
