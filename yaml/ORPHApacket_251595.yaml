  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare low-grade astrocytoma characterized by a high degree of cellular
      differentiation slow growth and diffuse infiltration of adjacent brain structures
      and corresponding to WHO grade II. The tumor typically affects young adults
      and has an intrinsic tendency for progression to high-grade glioma. Histological
      variants are fibrillary gemistocytic and protoplasmic astrocytoma. Patients
      most commonly present with seizures but also with other neurological or neuropsychological
      abnormalities depending on the location.
