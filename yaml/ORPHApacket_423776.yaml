  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary gastric cancer refers to the occurrence of gastric cancer
      in a familial context and is described as two or more cases of gastric cancer
      in first or second degree relatives with at least one case diagnosed before
      the age of 50. Familial clustering is observed in 10% of all cases of gastric
      cancer and includes hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (early onset diffuse-type
      gastric cancer) gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach
      (see these terms) and familial intestinal gastric cancer (familial clustering
      of intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma). Hereditary gastric cancer can also
      occur in other hereditary cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome Li-Fraumeni
      syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis and juvenile polyposis syndrome (see
      these terms).
