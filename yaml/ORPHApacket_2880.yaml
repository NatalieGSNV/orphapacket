  TextSection:
    Contents: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) deficiency is a gluconeogenesis
      disorder that results from impairment in the enzyme PEPCK and comprising cytosolic
      (PEPCK1) and mitochondrial (PEPCK2) forms of enzyme deficiency. Onset of symptoms
      is neonatal or a few months after birth and includes hypoglycemia associated
      with acute episodes of severe lactic acidosis progressive neurological deterioration
      severe liver failure renal tubular acidosis and Fanconi syndrome. Patients also
      present progressive multisystem damage with failure to thrive muscular weakness
      and hypotonia developmental delay with seizures spasticity lethargy microcephaly
      and cardiomyopathy. To date there is no conclusive evidence of the existence
      of an isolated form of this disorder.
