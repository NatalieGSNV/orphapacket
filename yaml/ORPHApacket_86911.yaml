    Contents: A rare childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome characterized by sudden onset
      of staring and unresponsiveness in association with rhythmical myoclonic jerks
      predominantly involving the superior upper limbs and leading to typical raising
      of the arms and shoulders. Ictal EEG shows bilateral synchronous symmetric 3-Hz
      spike-wave discharges. Other types of seizures (e. g. generalized tonic-clonic
      seizures) are often associated. Additional symptoms may include intellectual
      disability.
