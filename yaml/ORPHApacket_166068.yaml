    Contents: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 5 (PCH5) is a very rare severe form
      of PCH (see this terme) with prenatal onset and characterized by fetal onset
      of clonus or seizures-like activity persisting in infancy and microencephaly
      leading to early postnatal death. There is significant overlap both in phenotype
      and in genotype between pontocerebellar hypoplasia types 4 and 5.
