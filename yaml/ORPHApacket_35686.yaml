  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-infectious posterior uveitis characterized by usually bilateral
      chronic progressive recurrent inflammation of the choroid retinal pigment epithelium
      and choriocapillaris. In the classic or peripapillary geographic type of the
      disease infiltrates originating in the peripapillary region progress in an irregular
      serpentine fashion centrifugally and resolve spontaneously after several weeks
      leaving atrophic scars. Multiple recurrences often with months to years of quiescence
      in between result in progressive visual loss in one or both eyes.
