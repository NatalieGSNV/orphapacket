  TextSection:
    Contents: Periodic paralysis with transient compartment-like syndrome is a rare
      genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by normokalemic episodes of painful
      muscle cramping followed by progressive permanent flaccid weakness triggered
      by stress cold and exercise associated with myopathic myopathy and painful acute
      edema with neuronal compression foot drop and muscle degeneration when located
      in the tibialis anterior muscle group.
