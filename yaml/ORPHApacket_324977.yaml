    Contents: Proteasome disability syndrome describes a group of autosomal recessively
      inherited autoinflammatory disorders characterized by lipodystrophy and skin
      eruptions. The disorders belonging to this group include Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome
      (NNS) JMP syndrome and CANDLE syndrome and all are caused by mutations in the
      <i>PSMB8</i> gene (6p21.3).
