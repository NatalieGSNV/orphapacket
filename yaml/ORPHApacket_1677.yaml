    Contents: A rare congenital heart malformation of unknown etiology that is characterized
      by an extremely dilated right atrium and that is usually asymptomatic and fortuitously
      discovered by echocardiography or chest radiography and can be sometimes associated
      with other anomalies such as atrial arrhythmias (e.g. atrial flutter atrial
      fibrillation supraventricular tachycardia) severe tricuspid regurgitation or
      atrial thrombus that could lead to potentially life-threatening thromboembolic
      complications.
