  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial atrial fibrillation is a rare genetically heterogenous cardiac
      disease characterized by erratic activation of the atria with an irregular ventricular
      response in various members of a single family. It may be asymptomatic or associated
      with palpitations dyspnea and light-headedness. Concomitant rhythm disorders
      and cardiomyopathies are frequently reported.
