    Contents: Primary intraosseous venous malformation is a rare genetic vascular
      anomaly characterized by severe blood vessel expansion (most frequently within
      the craniofacial bones) with painless bone enlargement (usually of mandibule
      maxilla and/or orbital nasal and frontal bones) typically resulting in facial
      asymmetry and contour deformation. Midline abnormalities such as diastasis recti
      supraumbilical raphe and hiatus hernia are commonly associated. Additional features
      reported include gingival bleeding ectopic tooth eruption exophthalmos loss
      of vision nausea and vomiting.
