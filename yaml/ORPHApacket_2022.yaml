  TextSection:
    Contents: Endomyocardial fibroelastosis is a cause of unexplained childhood cardiac
      insufficiency. It results from diffuse thickening of the endocardium leading
      to dilated myocardiopathy in the majority of cases and restrictive myocardiopathy
      in rare cases. It may occur as a primary disorder or may be secondary to another
      cardiac malformation notably aortic stenosis or atresia.
