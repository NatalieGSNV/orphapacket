    Contents: X-linked dyserythropoietic anemia with abnormal platelets and neutropenia
      is a rare genetic constitutional dyserythropoietic anemia disorder characterized
      by moderate to severe anemia without thrombocytopenia variable degrees of neutropenia
      and bone marrow biopsy findings of trilineage dysplasia and hypocellularity
      of erythroid and granulocytic lineages. Peripheral blood findings include anisocytosis
