  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary angioedema characterized by potentially life-threatening
      episodes of subcutaneous and/or submucosal edema without urticaria associated
      with C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency. Hereditary angioedema (HAE)
      type 1 is caused by quantitative HAE type 2 by qualitative defects of C1-INH.
      The two subtypes are clinically indistinguishable. Patients may present at any
      age (but most commonly in childhood) with recurrent attacks of nonpitting edema
      of the skin severe abdominal symptoms such as pain and swelling and/or respiratory
      distress due to upper respiratory airways involvement. Genital bladder muscle
      or joint swelling may occur in some cases.
