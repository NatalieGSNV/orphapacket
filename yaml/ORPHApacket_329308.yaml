    Contents: Fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration (FAHN) is a very
      rare autosomal recessive form of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation
      (NBIA) characterized by childhood-onset focal dystonia progressive spastic paraplegia
      that progresses to tetra paresis ataxia dysarthria intellectual decline and
      oculomotor disturbances (optic atrophy) accompanied by iron deposition in the
      globus pallidus.
