  TextSection:
    Contents: Midline cervical cleft (MCC) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized
      by the presence at birth of a vertical atrophic and usually erythematous skin
      defect lacking adnexal elements in the midline of the neck that may be attached
      to a subcutaneous fibrous cord of variable length; a superior skin tag; and
      an inferior short (usually about 1 cm in length) sinus (possibly with presence
      of discharge). If untreated (by surgical removal) complications include restriction
      of neck extension due to contracture and scarring. It is sometimes associated
      with other developmental defects such as bifid mandible thyroglossal duct and
      branchial cysts and microgenia.
