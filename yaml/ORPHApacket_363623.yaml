    Contents: A form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy that can present from birth
      to early childhood characterized by hypotonia microcephaly mild proximal muscle
      weakness (leading to delayed walking and difficulty climbing stairs) mild intellectual
      disability and epilepsy. Additional manifestations reported in some patients
