  TextSection:
    Contents: Oromandibular-limb hypogenesis syndromes (OLHS) are a group of dysmorphic
      complexes (including Charlie M syndrome Hanhart syndrome and glossopalatine
      ankylosis; see these terms) characterized by the association of severe asymmetric
      limb defects (primarily involving distal segments) and abnormalities of the
      oral cavity and mandible (hypoglossia aglossia micrognathia glossopalatine ankylosis
      cleft palate and gingival anomalies).
