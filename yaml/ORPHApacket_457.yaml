    Contents: Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is the most severe variant of autosomal recessive
      congenital ichthyosis (ARCI; see this term). It is characterized at birth by
      the presence of large thick plate-like scales over the whole body associated
      with severe ectropion eclabium and flattened ears that later develops into a
      severe scaling erythroderma.
