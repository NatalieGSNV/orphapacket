    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: Split hand-split foot malformation (SHFM) refers to a spectrum of genetically
      and clinically heterogenous terminal limb defect (see this term) characterized
      by hypoplasia/ absence of central rays of the hands and feet (that can occur
      in one to all four digits) median clefts of the hands and/ or feet aplasia and
      syndactyly with a wide range of severity ranging from malformed central finger/
      toe to a lobster claw-like appearance of the hands and feet. SHFM can be an
      isolated malformation or can be a feature in various syndromes (ADULT syndrome
      EEC syndrome; see these terms). SHFM usually follows an autosomal dominant pattern
      of inheritance with incomplete penetrance but autosomal recessive and rarely
      X-linked inheritance have also been reported.
