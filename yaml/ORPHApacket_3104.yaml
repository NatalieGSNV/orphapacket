  TextSection:
    Contents: Robin sequence-oligodactyly syndrome is a rare genetic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by Robin sequence (i.e. severe
      micrognathia retroglossia and U-shaped cleft of the posterior palate) associated
      with pre- and postaxial oligodactyly. Facial features can include a narrow face
      and narrow lower dental arch. Clinodactyly absent phalanx metacarpal fusions
      and hypoplastic carpals have also been reported. There have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1986.
