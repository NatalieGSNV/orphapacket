  TextSection:
    Contents: Childhood encephalopathy due to thiamine pyrophosphokinase deficiency
      is a rare inborn error of metabolism disorder characterized by early-onset acute
      encephalopathic episodes (frequently triggered by viral infections) associated
      with lactic acidosis and alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria which typically manifest
      with variable degrees of ataxia generalized developmental regression (which
      deteriorates with each episode) and dystonia. Other manifestations include spasticity
      seizures truncal hypotonia limb hypertonia brisk tendon reflexes and reversible
      coma.
