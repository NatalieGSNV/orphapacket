    Contents: Blepharophimosis-intellectual disability syndrome SBBYS type is characterised
      by the association of congenital hypothyroidism facial dysmorphism (microcephaly
      blepharophimosis a bulbous nose thin lip low-set ears and micrognathia) postaxial
      polydactyly and severe intellectual deficit. Less than 20 cases have been reported
      so far. Cryptorchidism is present in affected males. Some patients also have
      cardiac anomalies (interventricular communication) hypotonia and growth delay.
      Autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested.
