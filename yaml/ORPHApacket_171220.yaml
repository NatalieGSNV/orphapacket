    Contents: Rectal duplication is a rare congenital anorectal malformation characterized
      by an egg-like cystic mucus-filled mass composed of intestinal mucosal lining
      and smooth muscle tissue. Commonly it presents in childhood with symptoms of
      recurrent urinary tract infections gastroenteritis obstruction perianal sepsis
      and rectal bleeding. Drainage of mucus or pus from the anus is also a typical
      presenting sign. The majority are found in the retro-rectal space where they
      communicate with or are contiguous to the rectum.
