    Contents: Autosomal recessive mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases
      (MSMD) due to partial IFNgammaR2 deficiency is a genetic variant of MSMD (see
      this term) characterized by a partial deficiency in IFN-gammaR2 leading to a
      residual response to IFN-gamma and consequently to recurrent moderately severe
      infections with bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) and other environmental mycobacteria
      (EM).
