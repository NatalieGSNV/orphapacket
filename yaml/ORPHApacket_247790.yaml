  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of iron metabolism and transport characterized by elevated
      serum ferritin levels increased serum iron increased transferrin saturation
      and heavy iron deposition in hepatocytes. Iron deposition has also been indicated
      in heart and bone marrow while hematological examination of peripheral blood
      shows no abnormalities.
