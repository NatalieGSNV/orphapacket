    Contents: A rare syndrome characterized by the association of lethal non-spherocytic
      non-immune hemolytic anemia with abnormalities of the external genitalia (micropenis
      and hypospadias) flat occiput dimpled earlobes deep plantar creases and increased
      space between the first and second toes. It has been described only once in
      two brothers who died a few hours after birth. The second-born infant had massive
      ascites and hepatosplenomegaly. The mother had two spontaneous abortions (at
      6 and 12 weeks gestation) but gave birth to a normal girl suggesting an autosomal
      or X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. Although the parents were not known
      to be consanguineous they shared a French-Canadian and American Indian ethnic
      origin.
