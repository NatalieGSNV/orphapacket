  TextSection:
    Contents: Hyperinsulism due to glucokinase deficiency (HIGCK) is a form of diazoxide-sensitive
      diffuse hyperinsulinism (see this term) caused by a lowered threshold for insulin
      release characterized by an excessive/ uncontrolled insulin secretion (inappropriate
      for the level of glycemia) and recurrent episodes of profound hypoglycemia induced
      by fasting and protein rich meals requiring rapid and intensive treatment to
      prevent neurological sequelae.
