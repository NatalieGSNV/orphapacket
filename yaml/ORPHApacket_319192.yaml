  TextSection:
    Contents: Diencephalic-mesencephalic junction dysplasia is a rare genetic non-syndromic
      cerebral malformation characterized by severe intellectual disability progressive
      postnatal microcephaly axial hypotonia spastic quadriparesis seizures and facial
      dysmorphism (bushy eyebrows hairy forehead broad nasal root long flat philtrum
      V-shaped upper lip). Additionaly talipes equinovarus non-obstructive cardiomyopathy
      persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous obstructive hydrocephalus and autistic
      features may also be associated. On brain magnetic resonance imaging the 'butterfly
      sign' is characterisitcally observed and cortical calcifications agenesis of
      the corpus callosum ventriculomegaly brainstem dysplasia and cerebellar vermis
      hypoplasia have also been described.
