  TextSection:
    Contents: Cholestasis-pigmentary retinopathy-cleft palate is a syndrome of multiple
      congenital malformations characterized by an association of cleft lip and palate
      patchy pigmentary retinopathy (cat's paw) obstructive liver disease (cholestasis
      portal hypertension etc.) and obstructive renal disease (ectopic ureteric insertion
      obstruction vesicouretral reflux and hydronephrosis). Gastrointestinal tract
      involvement (malrotation gastresophageal reflux etc.) and cardiac involvement
      (coarctation of aorta pulmonary artery stenosis etc.) have also been reported.
      An overlap with Kabuki syndrome is debated.
