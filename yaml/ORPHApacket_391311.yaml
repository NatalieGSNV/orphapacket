    Contents: Susceptibility to viral and mycobacterial infections is a rare genetic
      primary immunodeficiency due to a defect in innate immunity disorder characterized
      by impaired intracellular signaling from both type I and type II interferons
      leading to early-onset severe life-threatening intracellular bacterial (typically
      mycobacteria) and viral (mainly herpes viruses) infections.
