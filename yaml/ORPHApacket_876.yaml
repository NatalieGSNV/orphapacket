  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare germ cell tumor characterized by multiple patterns reflecting
      endodermal extraembryonal differentiation (secondary yolk sac and allantois)
      or endodermal somatic tissues (intestine liver and mesenchyme). The tumors most
      commonly occur in the second or third decade of life. They are typically located
      in the gonads occasionally also in other regions. Patients present with a pelvic
      mass and/or abdominal pain (females) or an often painless unilateral testicular
      mass (males). Elevated serum alpha fetoprotein is a common laboratory finding.
