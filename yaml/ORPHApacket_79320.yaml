    Contents: A form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation characterized
      by feeding problems mild-to-moderate neurologic involvement with hypotonia poor
      head control developmental delay ataxia strabismus and seizures ranging from
      febrile convulsions to epilepsy. Retinal degeneration has also been reported.
      A minority of patients show other manifestations particularly intestinal (such
      as protein-losing enteropathy) and liver involvement. The disease is caused
      by loss of function mutations of the gene <i>ALG6</i> (1p31.3).
