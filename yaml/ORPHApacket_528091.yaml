    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disease characterized by prenatal complications
      including oligohydramnios fetal growth restriction hydrops and anemia followed
      by severe lactic acidosis hyaline membrane disease pulmonary hypertension cardiac
      anomalies liver dysfunction urogenital abnormalities and progressive renal disease
      seizures thrombocytopenia and sideroblastic anemia resulting in multisystem
      organ failure and death shortly after birth. Less severely affected patients
      surviving the neonatal period and showing sensorineural hearing loss and developmental
      delay have been reported.
