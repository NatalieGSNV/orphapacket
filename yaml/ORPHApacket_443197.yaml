    Contents: A rare disorder of porphyrin and heme metabolism characterized by infantile
      or childhood onset of severe cutaneous photosensitivity in affected males presenting
      as tingling burning and itching within minutes of light exposure often accompanied
      by swelling and redness of the skin. Pain may persist for hours or days after
      the initial reaction. Some patients show hepatic involvement and gallstone formation.
      Laboratory examination reveals increased levels of zinc- and metal-free protoporphyrin.
      The phenotype in heterozygous females ranges from asymptomatic to severe.
