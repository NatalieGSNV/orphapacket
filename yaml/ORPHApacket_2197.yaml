    Contents: A rare renal disease characterized by excess urinary calcium excretion
      in the absence of an underlying systemic disease. The condition leads to an
      increased risk for the formation of kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis as well
      as reduced bone mineral density with increased incidence of fractures.
