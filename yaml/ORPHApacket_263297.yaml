  TextSection:
    Contents: Glycogen storage disease type 15 is an extremely rare genetic glycogen
      storage disease reported in one patient to date. Clinical signs included muscle
      weakness cardiac arrhythmia associated with accumulation of abnormal storage
      material in the heart and glycogen depletion in skeletal muscle.
