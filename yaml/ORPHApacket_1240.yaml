    Contents: Metaphyseal acroscyphodysplasia is an extremely rare form of metaphyseal
      dysplasia characterized by the distinctive radiological sign of cone-shaped
      upper tibial and lower femoral epiphyses embedded in large cup-shaped metaphyses
      associated with short stature and micromelia. Upper limb involvement includes
      brachydactyly and phalangeal and metacarpal cone-shaped epiphyses. The association
      of metaphyseal acroscyphodysplasia with psychomotor delay and alopecia has also
      been reported in some cases.
