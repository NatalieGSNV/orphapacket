  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy characterized
      by childhood onset of severe progressive proximal skeletal muscle weakness and
      atrophy of the upper and lower limbs with later involvement of distal muscles
      and development of severe quadraparesis calf hypertrophy triangular tongue and
      dilated cardiomyopathy. Skeletal muscles undergo diffuse bilateral symmetric
      and severe atrophy with fat infiltration.
