  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disease characterized by neonatal onset of severe
      cardiac and/or neurologic signs and symptoms mostly associated with a fatal
      outcome in the neonatal period or in infancy although a milder phenotype with
      later onset and slowly progressive neurologic deterioration has also been reported.
      Clinical manifestations are variable and include respiratory insufficiency hypotonia
      cardiomyopathy and seizures. Serum lactate is elevated in most cases. Brain
      imaging may show cerebellar atrophy or hypoplasia.
