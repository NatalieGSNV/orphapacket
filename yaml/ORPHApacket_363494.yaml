  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Testicular non seminomatous germ cell tumor describes a group of testicular
      germ cell tumors (see this term) occurring in the third decade of life (mean
      age: 25 years) with a usually painless unilateral mass in the scrotum or in
      some cases with gynaecomastia and/or back and flack pain and characterized by
      a more aggressive clinical course than testicular seminomatous germ cell tumors
      (see this term) with rapid involvement of blood vessels and a poorer prognosis.
      Histologically they can be either undifferentiated (embryonal carcinoma) differentiated
      (teratoma yolk sac tumor choriocarcinoma) or can consist of a mixture of seminomatous
      and nonseminomatous components.'
