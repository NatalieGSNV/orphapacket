  TextSection:
    Contents: Microcephaly-brain defect-spasticity-hypernatremia syndrome is a rare
      congenital genetic syndrome with a central nervous system malformation as a
      major feature characterized by microcephaly hypertonia developmental delay and
      cognitive impairment swallowing difficulty hypernatremia and hypoplasia of the
      frontal parts and fusion of the lateral ventricles on brain MRI. There have
