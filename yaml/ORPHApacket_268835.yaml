    Contents: Lipomyelomeningocele is a rare neural tube closure defect characterized
      by a subcutaneous lipoma that extends through a defect in the lumbodorsal fascia
      vertebral neural arch and dura. This painless lesion can occur anywhere along
      the spinal canal but usually is found in the sacral or lumbar region. If left
      untreated it can cause tethered cord syndrome.
