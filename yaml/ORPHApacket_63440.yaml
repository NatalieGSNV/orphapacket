  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated oxycephaly is a late-appearing form of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis
      characterized by premature fusion of both the coronal and sagittal sutures and
      in some cases of the lambdoid sutures. Compensatory growth in the region of
      the anterior fontanel results in a pointed or cone-shaped skull.
