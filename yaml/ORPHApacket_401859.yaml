    Contents: Lipoic acid synthetase deficiency is a rare neurometabolic disease characterized
      by a neonatal onset of seizures (often intractable) muscular hypotonia feeding
      difficulties (poor sucking and/or swallowing) and mild to severe psychomotor
      delay associated with nonketotic hyperglycinemia typically revealed by biochemical
      analysis. Respiratory problems (apnea acute respiratory acidosis) lethargy hearing
      loss microcephaly and spasticity with pyramidal signs may also be associated.
