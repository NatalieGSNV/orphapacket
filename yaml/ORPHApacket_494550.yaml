    Contents: A rare head and neck tumor characterized by a malignant epithelial neoplasm
      with evidence of squamous differentiation most commonly located in the supraglottis
      or glottis. The tumor can spread directly to adjacent structures or metastasize
      via lymphatic and blood vessels to regional lymph nodes or lung liver and bones
      respectively. Primary risk factors are tobacco smoking and (to a lesser extent)
      alcohol consumption. Patients may present with hoarseness dyspnea stridor dysphagia
      hemoptysis or odynophagia.
