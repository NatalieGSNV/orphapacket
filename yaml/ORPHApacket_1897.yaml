    Contents: EEM syndrome is characterised by the association of ectodermal dysplasia
      ectrodactyly and macular dystrophy. So far it has been described in individuals
      from seven families. Hypotrichosis dental anomalies and absent eyebrows have
      also been reported. EMM syndrome appears to be transmitted as an autosomal recessive
      trait and may be caused by mutations in the cadherin-3 gene (<i>CH3</i> 16q22.1).
