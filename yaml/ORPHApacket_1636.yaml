  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal monosomy 7q36 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting
      from a partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 with a highly variable
      phenotype typically characterized by holoprosencephaly growth restriction developmental
      delay facial dysmorphism (facial clefts prominent forehead hypertelorism low-set
      ears flat and broad nasal bridge large mouth) abnormal fingers and palm or sole
      creases ocular abnormalities and other congenital malformations (incl. genital
      anomalies and caudal deficiency sequence). Cardiopathies have been occasionally
      reported.
