    Contents: A rare acquired human prion disease characterized by a progressive invariably
      fatal neuropsychiatric disorder resulting from transmission via consumption
      of products from prion-diseased cows or via blood transfusion from an affected
      individual. Patients typically present early psychiatric symptoms (such as depression
      anxiety apathy withdrawal and delusions) as well as persistent painful sensory
      symptoms ataxia myoclonus chorea or dystonia and dementia. Brain MRI often shows
      bilateral FLAIR hyperintensities involving the pulvinar thalamic nuclei. Neuropathological
      examination reveals spongiform change and extensive deposition of abnormal prion
      protein with florid plaques throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum.
