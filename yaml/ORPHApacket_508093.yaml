  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by childhood-onset
      dystonia with distinctive MRI changes in the basal ganglia and optic atrophy
      developing either immediately or within a few years after the appearance of
      dystonia. Additional symptoms include chorea and other movement disorders dysarthria
      or nystagmus among others. Motor disability progresses gradually while cognitive
      function is relatively spared.
