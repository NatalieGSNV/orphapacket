    Contents: X-linked recessive hypoparathyroidism (XLHPT) is a very rare cause of
      hypoparathyroidism. It has been reported in two multigeneration families from
      Missouri. Affected males suffer from true neonatal idiopathic hypoparathyroidism
      leading to severe hypocalcemia with undetectable parathyroid hormone levels
      and epilepsy. They are also sterile. Carrier females are normocalcemic and asymptomatic.
      XLHPT is caused by congenital parathyroid gland agenesis. The XLHPT locus has
      been mapped to chromosome Xq26-q27 in a 1.5 Mb interval flanked by markers F9
      and DXS984. Neonatal onset and parathyroid agenesis found at autopsy in one
      of the patients suggest that the gene involved in XLHPT plays a role in parathyroid
      gland development.
