  TextSection:
    Contents: Mixed autoinflammatory and autoimmune syndrome is a group of systemic
      diseases characterized by mixed patterns of dysregulated innate and/or adaptive
      immune responses leading to chronic activation of the immune system and tissue
      inflammation which presents clincally with a wide range of variable concomitant
      autoimmune and autoinflammatory manifestations in various organ systems.
