  TextSection:
    Contents: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a group of rare monogenic
      primary immunodeficiency disorders characterized by a lack of functional peripheral
      T lymphocytes resulting in early-onset severe respiratory infections and failure
      to thrive. They are classified according to immunological phenotype into SCID
      with absence of T cells but presence of B cells (T-B+ SCID) or SCID with absence
      of both (T-B- SCID) (see these terms). Both of these groups include several
      forms with or without natural killer (NK) cells.
