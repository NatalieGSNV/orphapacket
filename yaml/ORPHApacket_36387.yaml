    Contents: Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a familial
      epilepsy syndrome in which family members display a seizure disorder from the
      GEFS+ spectrum which ranges from simple febrile seizures (FS) to the more severe
      phenotype of myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE) or Dravet syndrome (DS) (see these
      terms).
