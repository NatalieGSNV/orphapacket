  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a form of
      bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia that is often associated with adrenocorticotrophin
      hormone (ACTH) independent Cushing syndrome (see this term) and is characterized
      by small to normal sized adrenal glands containing multiple small cortical pigmented
      nodules (less than 1 cm in diameter).
