  TextSection:
    Contents: Polydactyly of a triphalangeal thumb or PPD2 is a form of preaxial polydactyly
      of fingers (see this term) a limb malformation syndrome that is characterized
      by the presence of a usually opposable triphalangeal thumb with or without additional
      duplication of one or more skeletal components of the thumb. The thumb appearance
      can differ widely in shape (wedge to rectangular) or it can be deviated in the
      radio-ulnar plane (clinodactyly). PPD2 is also associated with systemic syndromes
      including Holt-Oram syndrome and Fanconi anemia (see these terms).
