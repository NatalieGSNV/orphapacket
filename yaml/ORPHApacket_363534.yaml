    Contents: Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome hepatocerebrorenal form is a rare
      genetic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome characterized by neonatal or early-infantile
      onset hepatopathy (manifesting with hepatomegaly cholestasis increased transaminases
      coagulopathy hypoalbuminemia ascites and/or liver failure) associated with renal
      tubulopathy and progressive neurodegenerative manifestations which include muscular
      atrophy hypore&#64258;exia ataxia sensory neuropathy epilepsy sensorineural
      hearing impairment psychomotor regression athetosis nystagmus and/or ophthalmoplegia.
      Patients typically present with recurrent vomiting severe failure to thrive
      feeding difficulties and fasting hypoglycemia.
