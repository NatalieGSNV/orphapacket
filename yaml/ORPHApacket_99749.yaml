    Contents: Kostmann syndrome is a rare severe congenital neutropenia disorder characterized
      by a lack of mature neutrophils (absolute neutrophil counts less than 500 cells/mm3)
      associated with frequent recurrent bacterial infections (e.g. otitis media pneumonia
      sinusitis urinary tract infections abscesses of skin and/or liver) and increased
      promyelocytes in the bone marrow. Periodontal disease as well as neurological
      symptoms such as cognitive impairment severe neurodegeneration and epilepsy
      have been reported in some patients.
