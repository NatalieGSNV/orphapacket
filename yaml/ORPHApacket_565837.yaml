  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized
      by childhood to adult onset of slowly progressive limb girdle muscular weakness
      often accompanied by calf hypertrophy and moderately elevated creatine kinase
      levels. Patients remain ambulatory but may variably present mild intellectual
      disability seizures migraine or cardiopulmonary involvement. Occurrence of dilated
      cardiomyopathy has been reported. Brain MRI typically shows hyperintensity in
      T2-weighted sequences. Muscle biopsy commonly reveals dystrophic features.
