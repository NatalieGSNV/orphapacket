  TextSection:
    Contents: Craniosynostosis-fibular aplasia syndrome is an extremely rare genetic
      disease reported in only 2 brothers to date characterized by the combination
      of craniosynostosis (involving both coronal sutures) congenital absence of the
      fibula cryptorchidism and bilateral simian creases. Intelligence is normal and
      an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance has been proposed. There have been
      no further reports in the literature since 1972.
