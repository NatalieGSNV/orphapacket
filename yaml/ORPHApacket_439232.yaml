    Contents: A rare systemic amyloidosis characterized by slowly progressive renal
      dysfunction increased serum creatinine mostly normal urine analysis with no
      significant proteinuria and associated heart disease. Cardiac involvement presents
      as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
      coronary artery disease and conduction system abnormalities. Histology reveals
      renal tubular atrophy interstitial fibrosis glomerular sclerosis and medullar
      amyloid deposits.
