    Contents: Brachydactyly type C (BDC) is a very rare congenital malformation characterized
      by brachymesophalangy of the index middle and little fingers with hyperphalangy
      of the index and middle finger and shortening of the 1st metacarpal. Only few
      families with BDC have been reported in the literature. The ring finger is usually
      the longest digit. Short metacarpals and symphalangism are occasionally present.
      Heterozygous mutations in the cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein 1 also
      known as growth/differentiation factor-5 gene (<i>GDF5</i>) have been reported
      in BDC patients. Many studies support an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.
