    Contents: Hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy with hyperelastic skin is a rare
      genetic demyelinating hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy disorder characterized
      by slowly progressive mild to moderate distal muscle weakness and atrophy of
      the upper and lower limbs and variable distal sensory impairment associated
      with variable hyperextensible skin and age-related macular degeneration. Hypermobility
      of distal joints high palate and minor skeletal abnormalities (e.g. pectus excavatus
      dolichocephaly) may also be associated.
