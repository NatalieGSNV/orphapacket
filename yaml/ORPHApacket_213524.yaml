  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary site-specific ovarian cancer syndrome refers to ovarian cancer
      caused by germline mutations in various genes usually associated with additional
      cancer risks. The most common are breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC)
      due to mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes and hereditary nonpolyposis
      colorectal cancer (HNPCC) due to mutations in DNA mismatch-repair genes. Mutations
      in <i>STK11</i> gene causing Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are also associated with
      a risk of ovarian cancer (typically sex cord stromal tumors). Mutations in other
      genes including <i>RAD51C</i> <i>RAD51D</i> <i>PALB2</i> confer an elevated
      ovarian cancer risk in a minority of patients.
