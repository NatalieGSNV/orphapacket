    Contents: X-linked epilepsy-learning disabilities-behavior disorders syndrome
      is characterized by epilepsy learning difficulties macrocephaly and aggressive

      is transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait and is likely to be caused by
      mutations in the gene encoding synapsin I (Xp11.3-q12).
