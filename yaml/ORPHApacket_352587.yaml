    Contents: Focal epilepsy-intellectual disability-cerebro-cerebellar malformation
      is a rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by early infantile-onset
      of seizures borderline to moderate intellectual disability cerebellar features
      including dysarthria and ataxia and cerebellar atrophy and cortical thickening
      observed on MRI imaging. Seizures are typically focal (with prominent eye blinking
      facial and limb jerking) precipitated by fever and often commence with an oral
      sensory aura (anesthetized tongue sensation). When not properly controlled by
      anti-epileptic medication weekly frequency and persistance into adult life is
      observed.
