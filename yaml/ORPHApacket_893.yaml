  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disorder characterized by the association of total or
      partial aniridia genitourinary anomalies (ranging from sexual ambiguity to ectopia
      testis) variable degrees of intellectual disability and an increased risk of
      developing Wilms tumor. Glaucoma or cataract are also possible and a minority
      of patients develop kidney failure. Other varaible findings may include obesity
      and duplicated halluces.
