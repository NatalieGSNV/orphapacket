    Contents: Osteogenesis imperfecta type III is a severe type of osteogenesis imperfecta
      (OI; see this term) a genetic disorder characterized by increased bone fragility
      low bone mass and susceptibility to bone fractures. The main signs of type III
      include very short stature a triangular face severe scoliosis grayish sclera
      and dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI; see this term).
