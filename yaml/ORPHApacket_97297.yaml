    Contents: A rare life-threatening mutliple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized
      by intrauterine growth restriction postnatal failure to thrive and facial dysmorphism
      (microcephaly or trigonocephaly prominent glabellar nevus flammeus (simplex)
      fading with age hypotonic facies low frontal and temporal hairline hirsutism
      synophrys prominent or proptotic eyes hypertelorism upslanting palpebral fissures
      depressed and wide nasal bridge anteverted nares full cheeks low-set and posteriorly
      angulated ears cleft lip and/or palate high arched palate micrognathia and/or
      retrognathia). A specific posture (BOS posture) is also reported characterized
      by external rotation and/or adduction of the shoulders flexion at the elbows
      and wrists ulnar deviation of the wrists and/or the metacarpophalangeal joints.
      Additional features mainly include severe feeding difficulties chronic emesis
      recurrent infections hypertrichosis seizures truncal hypotonia and hypertonic
      extremities as well as cerebral ocular cardiac and other skeletal anomalies
      central obesity severe intellectual disability sleep disturbance urinary retention
