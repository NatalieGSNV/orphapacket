  TextSection:
    Contents: Sick sinus syndrome is a rare cardiac rhythm disease usually of the
      elderly characterized by electrocardiographic findings of sinus bradycardia
      atrial fibrillation atrial tachycardia sinus arrest or sino-atrial block and
      that manifest with symptoms like syncope dizziness palpitations fatigue or even
      heart failure. It results from malfunction of the cardiac conduction system
      probably secondary to degenerative fibrosis of nodal tissue in the elderly or
      secondary to cardiac disorders in younger patients.
