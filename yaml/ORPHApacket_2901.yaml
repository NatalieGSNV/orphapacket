  TextSection:
    Contents: Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is an uncommon disorder of the peripheral
      nervous system characterized by the sudden onset of extreme pain in the upper
      extremity followed by rapid multifocal motor weakness and atrophy and a slow
      recovery in months to years. NA includes both an idiopathic (INA also known
      as Parsonage-Turner syndrome) and hereditary (HNA) form.
