  TextSection:
    Contents: Cryptomicrotia - brachydactyly - excess fingertip arch syndrome describes
      a combination of malformations that include bilateral cryptomicrotia brachytelomesophalangy
      with short middle and distal phalanges of digits 2 through 5 hypoplastic toenails
      and excess fingertip arch patterns and has been reported in one family (mother
      and son). Cryptomicrotia - brachydactyly - excess fingertip arch syndrome is
      thought to follow an autosomal dominant transmission. There have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1988.
