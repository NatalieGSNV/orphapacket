      of edema massive or nephrotic-range proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia for which
      there is no known cause. Depending on response to treatment disease is distinguished
      into steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and steroid-resistant nephrotic
      syndrome (SRNS) with the latter being further divided depending on occurrence
