  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare motor neuron disease characterized by isolated lower motor neuron
      features including progressive flaccid weakness muscle atrophy fasciculations
      and reduced or absent tendon reflexes. Onset is in late adulthood with men being
      affected more often than women. Upper motor neuron signs may develop later in
      some cases. Occurrence of respiratory insufficiency determines the prognosis.
      Neuropathological analysis shows intraneuronal Bunina bodies and ubiquitin-positive
      inclusions.
