    Contents: Epilepsy-microcephaly-skeletal dysplasia syndrome is characterized by
      the association of moderate to severe intellectual deficit microcephaly epilepsy
      coarse face hirsutism and skeletal abnormalities (scoliosis and retarded bone
      development). It has been described only once in two sibs (one male and one
      female). This syndrome is likely to be an autosomal recessive condition and
      thus parents should be informed of a 25% risk of recurrence for other children.
