  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic non-dystrophic myopathy disease characterized by childhood-onset
      severe external ophthalmoplegia typically without ptosis associated with mild
      very slowly progressive muscular weakness and atrophy involving the facial neck
      flexor and limb (upper > lower proximal > distal) muscles. Muscle biopsy shows
      type 1 fiber uniformity absent or abnormally small type 2A fibers increased
      variability of fiber size internalized nuclei and/or fatty infiltration.
