    Contents: Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC) is a very rare autosomal
      dominant skeletal dysplasia characterized by short-limbed short stature (due
      to severe metaphyseal changes that are often discovered in childhood by imaging)
      waddling gait bowed legs contracture deformities of the joints short hands with
      clubbed fingers clinodactyly prominent upper face and small mandible as well
      as chronic parathyroid hormone-independent hypercalcemia hypercalciuria and
