    Contents: A syndrome associating neonatal diabetes congenital hypothyroidism congenital
      glaucoma hepatopathy evolving to fibrosis and polykystic kidneys has been described
      in two sibs. Minor facial anomalies were also observed. Two other families presented
      incomplete forms of this syndrome. Mutations in <i>GLIS3</i> encoding for the
      transcription factor GLI similar 3 seem to be responsible of the syndrome.
