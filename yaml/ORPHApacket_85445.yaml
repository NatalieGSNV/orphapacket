  TextSection:
    Contents: Secondary amyloidosis is a form of amyloidosis (see this term) that
      complicates chronic inflammatory disorders (mainly rheumatoid arthritis see
      this term) and is characterized by the aggregation and deposition of amyloid
      fibrils composed of serum amyloid A protein an acute phase reactant. Although
      spleen suprarenal gland liver and gut are frequent sites of amyloid deposition
      the clinical picture is dominated by renal involvement.
