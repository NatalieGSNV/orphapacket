    Contents: Galactosemia is a group of rare genetic metabolic disorders characterized
      by impaired galactose metabolism resulting in a range of variable manifestations
      encompassing a severe life-threatening disease (classic galactosemia) a rare
      mild form (galactokinase deficiency) causing cataract and a very rare form with
      variable severity (galactose epimerase deficiency) resembling classic galactosemia
      in the severe form (see these terms).
