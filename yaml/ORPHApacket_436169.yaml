  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic coagulation disorder characterized by marked bleeding
      tendency and posttraumatic bleeding with easy bruising soft tissue and muscle
      bleeding hemarthroses and menorrhagia due to an increase of soluble thrombomodulin
      in plasma with subsequent protein C activation and reduction of thrombin generation
      within a potential thrombus. Abnormal laboratory findings include markedly elevated
      plasma thrombomodulin reduced prothrombin consumption and decreased thrombin
      generation.
