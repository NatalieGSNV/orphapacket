    Contents: Temple-Baraitser syndrome is a rare developmental anomalies syndrome
      characterized by severe intellectual disability and distal hypoplasia of digits
      particularly of thumbs and halluces with nail aplasia or hypoplasia. Facial
      dysmorphism with a pseudo-myopathic appearance has been reported which may include
      high anterior hairline or low frontal hairline with central cowlick flat forehead
      ptosis hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures epicanthal folds ears with
      thick helices broad depressed nasal bridge with anteverted nares short columella
      long philtrum high-arched palate broad mouth with thick vermilion border of
