    Contents: A rare variant of autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) associating
      the typical optic atrophy with other extra-ocular manifestations such as sensorineural
      deafness myopathy chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia ataxia and peripheral
      neuropathy. More rarely other manifestations have been associated with this
      condition such as spastic paraplegia multiple-sclerosis like illness.
