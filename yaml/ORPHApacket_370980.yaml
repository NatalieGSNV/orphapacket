    Contents: Congenital muscular dystrophy without intellectual disability is a rare
      genetic congenital muscular dystrophy due to dystroglycanopathy disorder characterized
      by a wide phenotypic spectrum which includes hypotonia and muscular weakness
      present at birth or early infancy delayed or arrested motor development and
      normal intellectual abilities with normal (or only mild abnormalities) neuroimaging
      studies. Feeding difficulties joint and spinal deformities and respiratory insufficiency
      may be associated. Decreased alpha-dystroglycan on immunohistochemical muscle
      staining and elevated serum creatine kinase are observed.
