  TextSection:
    Contents: A progressive muscular dystrophy characterized by co-existence of limb-girdle
      weakness and diffuse joint contractures without cardiomyopathy. Patients present
      lower limb weakness progressing to involve also upper limbs and axial muscles
      and eventually leading to permanent loss of ambulation widespread joint contractures
      in the limbs and sometimes the spine and variable respiratory involvement. Morphological
      changes in muscle biopsies include rimmed vacuoles increased internal nuclei
      cytoplasmic bodies and a dystrophic pattern.
