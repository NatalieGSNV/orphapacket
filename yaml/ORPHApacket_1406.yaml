  TextSection:
    Contents: Charlie M syndrome is a rare bone developmental disorder which belongs
      to a group of oromandibular limb hypogenesis syndromes that includes hypoglossia-hypodactyly
      and glossopalatine ankylosis (see these terms). The major anomalies which occur
      commonly in this group are hypoplasia of the mandible syndactyly and ectrodactyly
      small mouth cleft palate hypodontia and facial paralysis. Patients with Charlie
      M syndrome also present with hypertelorism absent or conically crowned incisors
      and variable degrees of hypodactyly of the hands and feet. There have been no
      further descriptions in the literature since 1976.
