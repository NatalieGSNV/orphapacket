  TextSection:
    Contents: Pseudodiastrophic dysplasia is characterized by rhizomelic shortening
      of the limbs and severe clubfoot deformity in association with elbow and proximal
      interphalangeal joint dislocations platyspondyly and scoliosis. It has been
      described in about 10 patients. An autosomal recessive inheritance has been
      suggested. Pseudodiastrophic dysplasia differs from diastrophic dysplasia (see
      this term) on the basis of clinical radiographic and histopathologic findings.
      Clubfoot can be treated by surgical therapy and neonatal contractures and scoliosis
      can be relieved by physical therapy. Several of the reported patients died in
      the neonatal period or during infancy.
