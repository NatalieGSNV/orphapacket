  TextSection:
    Contents: Bifid nose is a rare congenital malformation of presumed autosomal dominant
      or recessive inheritance characterized by clefting of the nose ranging from
      a minimally noticeable groove in the columella to complete clefting of the underlying
      bones and cartilage (resulting in two half noses) with a usually adequate airway.
      Bifid nose may be seen in frontonasal dysplasia while other malformations such
      as hypertelorbitism and midline clefts of the lip may also be associated.
