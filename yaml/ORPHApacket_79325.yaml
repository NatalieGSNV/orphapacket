  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation that is characterized
      by gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea vomiting feeding problems with failure
      to thrive protein-losing enteropathy) edema and ascites (including hydrops fetalis)
      hepatomegaly renal tubulopathy coagulation anomalies due to thrombocytopenia
      brain involvement (psychomotor delay seizures ataxia) facial dysmorphism (low-set
      ears and retrognathia) pes equinovarus and muscular hypotonia. Cataracts may
      also be observed. Prognosis is usually poor. The disease is caused by loss-of-function
      mutations in the gene <i>ALG8</i> (11q14.1) resulting in a block in the initial
      step of protein glycosylation.
