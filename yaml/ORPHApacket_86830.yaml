      neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid precursors in the
      bone marrow blood and other tissues (spleen liver) with clinical morphological
      and molecular features of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) failing to meet
      criteria of a specific MPN. The presentation is nonspecific and variable and
      often includes leukocytosis thrombocytosis and anemia. Splenomegaly hepatomegaly
