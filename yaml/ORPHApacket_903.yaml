    Contents: 'von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused
      by a genetic anomaly leading to quantitative structural or functional abnormalities
      of the Willebrand factor (von Willebrand factor; VWF). Two major groups of VWF
      deficiency have been defined: quantitative and partial (type 1) or total (type
      3) and qualitative (type 2) with several subtypes (2A 2B 2M 2N; see these terms).'
