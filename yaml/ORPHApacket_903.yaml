    Contents: 'A rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by defective platelet
      adhesion and secondary coagulation defect that manifests as abnormal bleeding
      of variable severity occurring either spontaneously or in association with an
      invasive procedure. Three main subtypes are defined based on the type of von
      Willebrand factor defect: partial (type 1) or total (type 3) deficiency and
      qualitative/functional anomalies (type 2).'
