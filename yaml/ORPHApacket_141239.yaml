      defect during embryogenesis characterized by a midline vertical cleft through
      the upper lip and premaxillary bone (can also involve the nasal septum and central
      nervous system). The phenotypic spectrum is highly variable (ranging from a
      simple vermillion notch to a wide complete cleft) and hypo/hypertelorism telecanthus
