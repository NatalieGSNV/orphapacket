  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome characterized by neonatal
      or infantile onset of hypotonia failure to thrive global developmental delay
      and persistent lactic acidosis. The disease course is variable and ranges from
      intractable diarrhea and respiratory failure with fatal outcome in early infancy
      to a milder phenotype with survival into childhood. Additional reported features
      include sensorineural hearing loss microcephaly seizures pigmentary retinopathy
      and renal tubulopathy.
