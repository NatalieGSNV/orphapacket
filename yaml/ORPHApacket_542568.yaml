    Contents: A rare congenital aortic malformation characterized by an aortic valve
      with four cusps instead of the usual three. The cusps can be equal-sized or
      vary in size. The malformation is an isolated finding in the majority of cases
      but may also be associated with other cardiac anomalies. The most common complication
      is aortic regurgitation. Aortic stenosis is infrequently observed. Patients
      usually become symptomatic in the fifth to sixth decade of life and may present
      with palpitations chest pain dyspnea fatigue pedal edema and syncope. In severe
      cases congestive heart failure can be the presenting symptom.
