  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by
      partial T lymphopenia (in particular cytotoxic CD8+ cells) and decreased expression
      of the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex with impaired proliferative response
      to TCR-dependent stimuli while the mature memory T cell pool is comparatively
      well preserved and B cells natural killer cells and immunoglobulins are typically
      normal. The clinical phenotype is highly heterogeneous ranging from asymptomatic
      to infancy-onset of severe recurrent infections as well as occurrence of autoimmune
      disease or enteropathy.
