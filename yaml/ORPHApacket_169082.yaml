    Contents: Combined immunodeficiency due to CD3gamma deficiency is an extremely
      rare genetic combined primary immunodeficiency characterized by a selective
      partial lymphopenia (T+/-B+NK+) phenotype and decreased CD3 complex resulting
      in a variable but usually mild clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic
      until adulthood to high susceptibility to infections from early infancy with
      predominant automimmune manifestations.
