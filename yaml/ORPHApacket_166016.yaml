    Contents: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia Lowry type is a rare primary bone dysplasia
      characterized by small flat epiphyses (esp. the capital femoral epiphyses) rhizomelic
      shortening of limbs cleft of secondary palate micrognathia mild joint contractures
      and facial dysmorphism (incl. mildly upward-slanting palpebral fissures hypertelorism
      broad nasal tip). Additionally reported features include scoliosis genu valgum
      mild pectus excavatum platyspondyly dislocated radial heads brachydactyly hypoplastic
      fibulae and talipes equinovarus.
