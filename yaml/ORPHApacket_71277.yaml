    Contents: Glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome is characterized
      by an encephalopathy marked by childhood epilepsy that is refractory to treatment
      deceleration of cranial growth leading to microcephaly psychomotor retardation
      spasticity ataxia dysarthria and other paroxysmal neurological phenomena often
      occurring before meals. Symptoms appear between the age of 1 and 4 months following
      a normal birth and gestation.
