    Contents: Microcephalic primordial dwarfism Alazami type is a rare genetic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability
      distinct dysmorphic facial features (i.e. triangular face with prominent forehead
      narrow palpebral fissures deep-set eyes low-set ears broad nose malar hypoplasia
      short philtrum macrostomia widely spaced teeth) and pre and postnatal proportionate
      short stature ranging from primordial dwarfism (height below -3.5 SD) to a milder
      phenotype with less severe growth restriction (height below -2.5 SD). Other
      reported features include skeletal findings (e.g. scoliosis) microcephaly involuntary
      hand movements hypersensitivity to stimuli and behavioral problems such as anxiety.
