  TextSection:
    Contents: Desbuquois syndrome (DBQD) is an osteochondrodysplasia characterized
      by severe micromelic dwarfism facial dysmorphism joint laxity with multiple
      dislocations vertebral and metaphyseal abnormalities and advanced carpotarsal
      ossification. Two forms have been distinguished on the basis of the presence
      (type 1) or the absence (type 2) of characteristic hand anomalies. A variant
      form of DBQD Kim variant (see these terms) has also been described and is characterized
      by short stature and articular minor facial and significant hand anomalies.
