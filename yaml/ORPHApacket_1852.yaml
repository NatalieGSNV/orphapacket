  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic eye disease characterized by abnormal proliferation of
      retinal tissue resulting in the formation of retinal folds thereby causing gliosis
      and clinically variable degrees of visual impairment. No clinical findings other
      than those associated with the eyes have been demonstrated.
