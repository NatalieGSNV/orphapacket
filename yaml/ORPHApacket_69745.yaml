    Contents: A rare benign epidermal disease characterized by a solitary asymptomatic
      verrucous skin-coloured to red-brown papule or nodule which contains a central
      pore and keratotic plug occuring most frequently on the scalp face and neck
      (rarely in the mouth under the nail plate or on the mons pubis). Occasionally
      lesions may be multiple and/or pruritic. Histologically a well-circumscribed
      cup-shaped keratin-filled invagination with prominent acantholytic dyskeratosis
      suprabasilar clefts and villi projecting into the clefts is observed.
