    Contents: Primary microcephaly-epilepsy-permanent neonatal diabetes syndrome is
      a rare genetic neurologic disease characterized by congenital microcephaly severe
      early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (manifesting as intractable myoclonic and/or
      tonic-clonic seizures) permanent neonatal insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
      and severe global developmental delay. Muscular hypotonia skeletal abnormalities
      feeding difficulties and dysmorphic facial features (including narrow forehead
      anteverted nares small mouth with deep philtrum tented upper lip vermilion)
      are frequently associated. Brain MRI reveals cerebral atrophy with cortical
      gyral simplification and aplasia/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.
