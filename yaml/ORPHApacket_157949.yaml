    Contents: A rare genetic non-severe combined immunodeficiency disease characterized
      by immunodeficiency (manifested by recurrent and/or severe bacterial and viral
      infections) destructive noninfectious granulomas involving skin mucosa and internal
      organs and various autoimmune manifestations (including cytopenias vitiligo
      psoriasis myasthenia gravis enteropathy). Immunophenotypically T-cell and B-cell
      lymphopenia hypogammaglobulinemia abnormal specific antibody production and
      impaired T-cell function are observed.
