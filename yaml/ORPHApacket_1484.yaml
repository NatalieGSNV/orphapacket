  TextSection:
    Contents: Contractures - ectodermal dysplasia - cleft lip/palate is an ectodermal
      dyplasia syndrome characterized by severe arthrogryposis multiple ectodermal
      dysplasia features cleft lip/palate facial dysmorphism growth deficiency and
      a moderate delay of psychomotor development. Ectodermal dysplasia manifestations
      include sparse brittle and hypopigmented hair xerosis multiple nevi small conical
      shaped teeth and hypodontia and facial dysmorphism with blepharophimosis deep-set
      eyes and micrognathia.
