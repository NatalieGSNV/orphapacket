    Contents: Bullous dystrophy macular type is a genetic disorder characterised by
      formation of bullae without traumatic origin alopecia hyperpigmentation acrocyanosis
      short stature microcephaly intellectual deficit tapering fingers and nail abnormalities.
      Two families (one of whom was Dutch and the other Italian) have been described
      up to now in which only males were affected. Transmission is X-linked recessive.
      The bullous dystrophy locus has been mapped to Xq26.3 in the Italian family
      and to Xq27.3 in the Dutch family.
