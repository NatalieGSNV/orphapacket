    Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngological malformation characterized by the presence
      of a dermoid cyst located on the dorsum of the nose which presents a fistula
      often extending to the intracranial region. Patients present a firm slow-growing
      mass which contains skin and dermal elements (including hair follicles and sebaceous
      glands) that do not transilluminate or compress and may be associated with intermittent
      or chronic discharge of sebaceous material soft tissue and skeletal deformity
      and local infection. Meningitis convulsions and cerebral abscess may be observed
      if intracranial extension exists.
