  TextSection:
    Contents: A hydatidiform mole is a benign gestational trophoblastic disease developing
      during pregnancy. Resulting from an abnormal fertilization characterized by
      trophoblastic proliferation normal embryo development is rendered impossible.
      Hydatidiform moles can be either complete or partial.
