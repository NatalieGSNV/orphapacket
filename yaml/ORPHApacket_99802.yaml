    Contents: Hemimegalencephaly is a rare cerebral malformation characterized by
      overgrowth of all or part of a cerebral hemisphere often with ipsilateral severe
      cortical dysplasia or dysgenesis white matter hypertrophy and dilated lateral
      ventricle presenting in early infancy with progressive hemiparesis severe psychomotor
      retardation and intractable seizures. Hemimegalencephaly may be an isolated
      finding or associated with other syndromes such as angioosteohypertrophic syndrome
      epidermal nevus syndrome and Ito hypomelanosis (see these terms). Management
      includes seizure control by antiepileptic medications and early hemispherectomy.
