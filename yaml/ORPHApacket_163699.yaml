    Contents: A rare soft tissue sarcoma characterized by a slowly growing painless
      space-occupying lesion composed of large uniform epitheloid cells arranged in
      solid nests and/or alveolar structures separated by thin sinusoidal vessels.
      The tumor mostly affects adolescents and young adults. Early metastasis most
      commonly to the lung bones and brain is a characteristic feature and relevant
      prognostic factor together with age at presentation and tumor size while histological
      features have no prognostic significance.
