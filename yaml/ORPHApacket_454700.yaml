  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of human prion diseases characterized by progressive invariably
      fatal neurodegeneration resulting from accidental transmission of prions. The
      group comprises iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) which results from
      transmission of CJD prions in the course of medical procedures or treatments
      and variant CJD (transmission via consumption of products from prion-diseased
      cows or via blood transfusion from an affected individual).
