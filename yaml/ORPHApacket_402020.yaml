    Contents: A subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities
      characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow blood
      and rarely other tissues. Bone marrow typically shows small hypolobated megakaryocytes
      and multilineage dyslplasia. Patients typically present with leukocytosis anemia
      variable platelet counts and a variety of nonspecific symptoms related to ineffective
      hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding bruising recurrent infections bone pain) and/or
      extramedullary site involvement (gingivitis splenomegaly). High resistance to
      conventional chemotherapy is reported.
