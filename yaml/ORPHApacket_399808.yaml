  TextSection:
    Contents: Male infertility with teratozoospermia due to single gene mutation is
      a rare genetic male infertility due to sperm disorder characterized by the presence
      of spermatozoa with abnormal morphology such as macrozoospermia or globozoospermia
      in over 85% of sperm resulting from mutation in a single gene known to cause
      teratozoospermia. It is a heterogeneous group that includes a wide range of
      abnormal sperm phenotypes affecting solely or simultaneously head neck midpiece
      and/or tail.
