    Contents: Summitt syndrome is an extremely rare disorder originally described
      in two brothers and characterized by mild to severe craniosynostosis and syndactyly
      obesity and normal intelligence. Acrocephaly brachydactyly clinodactyly mild
      syndactyly of the hands and feet genu valgum and marked obesity were later described
      in another patient. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1979. Summitt syndrome could be a variant of Carpenter syndrome.
