    Contents: Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) represents a diverse group of ubiquitous
      rare spindle cell neoplasms that may be benign or malignant and that most frequently
      arises from the pleura and peritoneum and rarely from other sites such as head
      and neck liver and skeletal muscle. SFT may be clinically asymptomatic or may
      present with enlarging mass compressive effects depending on the site involved
      and rarely with paraneoplastic manifestations (osteoarthropathy or hypoglycemia).
