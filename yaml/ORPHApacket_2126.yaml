  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare spindle cell neoplasm that may be benign or malignant and that
      most frequently arises from the pleura and peritoneum and rarely from other
      sites such as head and neck liver and skeletal muscle. SFT may be clinically
      asymptomatic or may present with enlarging mass compressive effects depending
      on the site involved and rarely with paraneoplastic manifestations (osteoarthropathy
      or hypoglycemia).
