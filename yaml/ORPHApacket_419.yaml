    Contents: Hyperprolinaemia type I is an inborn error of proline metabolism characterised
      by elevated levels of proline in the plasma and urine. The prevalence is unknown.
      The disorder is generally considered to be benign but associations with renal
      abnormalities epileptic seizures and other neurological manifestations as well
      as certain forms of schizophrenia have been reported. It is transmitted as an
      autosomal recessive trait and is caused by mutations in the proline dehydrogenase
      or proline oxidase gene (<i>PRODH</i> or <i>POX</i> 22q11.2).
