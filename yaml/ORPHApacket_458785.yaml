  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital hemangioma characterized by a superficial red to violaceous
      lesion with overlying telangiectasia and a surrounding pale halo which initially
      behaves like a rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma beginning to involute
      shortly after birth. Involution is then aborted and a residual tumor virtually
      indistinguishable from non-involuting congenital hemangioma remains. This lesion
      grows proportionally with the child and does not regress.
