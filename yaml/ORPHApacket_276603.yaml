  TextSection:
    Contents: "A rare congenital isolated hyperinsulinism disorder characterized by\
      \ diazoxide unresponsive recurrent episodes of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia\
      \ resulting from an excessive insulin secretion by the pancreatic b\xEAta-cells\
      \ due to Kir6.2 deficiency. Hypoglycemia may lead to variable clinical manifestation\
      \ ranging from asymptomatic hypoglycemia revealed by routine blood glucose monitoring\
      \ to macrosomia at birth mild to moderate hepatomegaly and life-threatening\
      \ hypoglycemic coma or status epilepticus further leading to poor neurological\
      \ outcome."
