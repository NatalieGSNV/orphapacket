    Contents: Familial adrenal hypoplasia with absent pituitary luteinizing hormone
      is a rare endocrine disease characterized by a miniature adult type of congenital
      adrenal hypoplasia (residual adrenal cortex is composed of a small amount of
      permanent adult cortex with normal structural organization) selective absence
      of pituitary luteinizing hormone in otherwise normal brain and neonatal demise.
