  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by
      peripheral blood leukocytosis due to increased numbers of morphologically dysplastic
      neutrophils and their precursors hypercellular bone marrow with granulocytic
      proliferation and dysplasia (with or without dysplasia in the erythroid and
      megakaryocytic lineages) and prominent dysgranulopoiesis but no or minimal absolute
      basophilia or monocytosis. Blasts account for less than 20% of leukocytes in
      the blood and bone marrow. BCR-ABL1 fusion is absent as well as PDGFRA PDGFRB
      or FGFR1 rearrangement or PCM1-JAK2. Patients may present with signs and symptoms
      related to splenomegaly anemia or thrombocytopenia. Prognosis is generally poor.
