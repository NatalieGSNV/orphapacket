  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by
      severe reduction in the cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules typically
      resulting in childhood-onset of chronic bacterial infections of the respiratory
      tract evolving to widespread bronchiectasis and respiratory insufficiency. Sterile
      necrotizing granulomatous skin lesions mainly involving the extremities and
      the mid-face may be observed in some patients. Severe viral infections do not
      occur as part of the condition. Atypical variants without respiratory or cutaneous
      manifestations as well as asymptomatic individuals have been reported.
