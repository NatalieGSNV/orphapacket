    Contents: A rare vaginal malformation characterized by the presence of a complete
      or incomplete septum dividing the vagina into two parallel cavities resulting
      from failure of reabsorption of the midline uterine septum between the two fused
      Müllerian ducts during embryogenesis. Patients are often asymptomatic but may
      present with menorrhagia dysmenorrhea dyspareunia infertility or spontaneous
      abortion. The condition may occur as an isolated malformation or in association
      with other Müllerian duct anomalies (such as septate uterus or uterus didelphys)
      or renal abnormalities.
