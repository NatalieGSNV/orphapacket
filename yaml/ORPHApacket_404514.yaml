  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma ocurring in the context of end-stage
      kidney disease and acquired cystic kidney disease characterized by a usually
      well circumscribed solid multifocal bilateral tumor with inter- or intracellular
      microlumen formation (leading to cribiform architecture). Tumors are often diagnosed
      incidentally in early stages although complications caused by renal cysts (dull
      flank or abdominal pain fever) or renal parenchymal bleeding may mask the underlying
      neoplastic process. Most have an indolent behavior.
