    Contents: A rare functional neutrophil defect characterized by increased susceptibility
      to aggressive periodontitis in otherwise young healthy individuals due to impaired
      polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis toward bacterial formylpeptides. The
      periodontitis is rapidly progressive with progredient destruction of periodontal
      tissue and attachment loss.
