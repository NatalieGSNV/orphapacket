    Contents: Non-amyloid fibrillary glomerulopathy (non-amyloid FGP) is a rare cause
      of glomerulonephritis (GN) characterized by glomerular accumulation of non-amyloid
      fibrils in the mesangium and the glomerular (and rarely tubular) basement membrane
      that mainly presents with renal insufficiency micro-hematuria and nephrotic
      range proteinuria. Non-amyloid FGP and immunotactoid glomerulopathy (ITG see
      this term) are often grouped together as pathogenetically related diseases.
