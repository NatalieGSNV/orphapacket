  TextSection:
    Contents: Lethal left ventricular non-compaction-seizures-hypotonia-cataract-developmental
      delay syndrome is rare genetic neurometabolic disease characterized by global
      developmental delay severe hypotonia seizures cataracts cardiomyopathy (including
      left or bi-ventricular hypertrophy dilated cardiomyopathy) and left ventricular
      non-compaction typically resulting in infantile or early-childhood death. Patients
      usually present metabolic lactic acidosis failure to thrive head lag respiratory
      problems and decrease in respiratory chain complex activity. Highly variable
      cerebral abnormalities have been reported and include microcephaly prominent
      extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid spaces diffuse neuronal loss and cortical/white
      matter gliosis.
