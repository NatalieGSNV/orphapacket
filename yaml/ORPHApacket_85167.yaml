  TextSection:
    Contents: Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia-cone-rod dystrophy syndrome is characterised
      by the association of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (marked by platyspondyly
      shortening of the tubular bones and progressive metaphyseal irregularity and
      cupping) with postnatal growth retardation and progressive visual impairment
      due to cone-rod dystrophy. So far it has been described in eight individuals.
      Transmission appears to be autosomal recessive.
