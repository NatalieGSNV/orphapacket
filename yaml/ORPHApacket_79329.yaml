  TextSection:
    Contents: MGAT2-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
      characterized by facial dysmorphism (large posteriorly rotated ears with prominent
      antihelices convex nasal ridge open mouth large and crowded teeth) stereotypic
      hand movements seizures and varying degrees of developmental delay. A bleeding
      tendency is also observed and this results from diminished platelet aggregation.
      The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene <i>MGAT2</i>
      (14q21).
