  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis or atresia is a rare progressive
      life-threatening great vessels anomaly characterized by narrowing and obstruction
      of one or more normally positioned PV at their junction with the left atrium
      that usually presents during early infancy with dyspnea tachypnea and repeated
      pulmonary infections and eventually when all PV of one lung are affected results
      in pulmonary hypertension (PH) and consecutive pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (PAH) (see this term). It may manifest as an isolated lesion or associated with
      other cardiac defects such as congenital pulmonary venous return anomaly (see
      this term) and septal defects.
