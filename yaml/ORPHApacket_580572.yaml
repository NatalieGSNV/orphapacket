  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare epithelial tumor of pancreas characterized by a solid nodular
      mass growing within dilated pancreatic ducts histologically composed of nodules
      of back-to-back tubular glands forming large cribriform structures with high-grade
      dysplasia and ductal differentiation. There is no overt production of mucin.
      About half of the tumors occur in the head of the pancreas one third involve
      the gland diffusely. Patients present with nonspecific symptoms including abdominal
      pain vomiting weight loss steatorrhea and diabetes mellitus while obstructive
      jaundice is uncommon. This tumor type accounts for less than 1% of exocrine
      neoplasms and 3% of intraductal neoplasms of the pancreas.
