  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndrome disease characterized by segmental
      and progressive overgrowth predominantly involving the adipose tissue or a mixture
      of adipose and fibrous tissue with variable involvement of subcutaneous and
      muscular tissue as well as skeletal overgrowth. Overgrowth severity and range
      is highly variable although frequently it is asymmetric and disproportionate
      it affects lower extremities more than the upper ones and progresses in a distal
      to proximal patten. Congenital overgrowth is typically associated.
