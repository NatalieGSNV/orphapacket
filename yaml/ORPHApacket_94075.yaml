  TextSection:
    Contents: Severe-immune mediated enteropathy describes a variety of intestinal
      disorders that can range from a serious early-onset systemic disease (IPEX;
      see this term) to a mild isolated gastrointestinal disease. In children it manifests
      with severe diarrhea and dehydration in the presence of characteristic antibodies
      (anti-enterocyte and anti-goblet cell) and in adults with chronic diarrhea malabsorption
      and weight loss.
