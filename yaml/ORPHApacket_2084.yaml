    Contents: Glaucoma-ectopia-microspherophakia-stiff joints-short stature syndrome
      is characterized by progressive joint stiffness glaucoma short stature and lens
      dislocation. It has been described in three members of a family (the grandfather
      his daughter and grandson). It is likely to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant
      trait. The acronym GEMSS (Glaucoma Ectopia Microspherophakia Stiff joints Short
      stature) was proposed as a name for the syndrome. This syndrome shows similarities
      to Moore-Federman syndrome (see this term).
