  TextSection:
    Contents: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) poisoning is a rare intoxication caused by the
      prolonged low-dose administration of 5-FU which is the mainstay of both adjuvant
      and advanced-disease chemotherapy regimens in colon cancer. 5-FU poisoning is
      characterized by gastrointestinal (nausea emesis diarrhea anorexia stomatitis)
      and hematologic (myelosuppression) toxicities as well as mucositis alopecia
      and occasionally palmar-plantar dysesthesia (more commonly known as hand-foot
      syndrome). Women have been reported to experience more 5-FU-related toxicity
      than men.
