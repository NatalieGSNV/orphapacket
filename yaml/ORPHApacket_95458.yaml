    Contents: A rare congenital non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by
      bulking of tricuspid valve into the right atrium during systole. It can be isolated
      but is more often associated with mitral valve prolapse or with other cardiac
      and lung diseases. Clinical presentation depends on severity and associated
      findings and there is a high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and possible bacterial
      endocarditis.
