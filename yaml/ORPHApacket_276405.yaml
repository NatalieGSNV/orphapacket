  TextSection:
    Contents: Hyperbiliverdinemia is a rare genetic hepatic disease characterized
      by the presence of green coloration of the skin urine plasma and other body
      fluids (ascites breastmilk) or parts (sclerae) due to increased serum levels
      of biliverdin in association with biliary obstruction and/or liver failure.
      Association with malnutrition medication and congenital biliary atresia has
      also been reported.
