  TextSection:
    Contents: Camptodactyly - fibrous tissue hyperplasia - skeletal dysplasia syndrome
      is an extremely rare chondrodysplastic malformation syndrome that is characterized
      by the combination of arachnodactyly becoming evident at around the age of 10
      camptodactyly (hammertoes) and scoliosis. A mild facial dysmorphism including
      a broad nose and flaring nostrils and a mild intellectual disability were also
      noted. Camptodactyly - fibrous tissue hyperplasia - skeletal dysplasia syndrome
      has been described once in 3 siblings and is suspected to follow autosomal recessive
      transmission. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1972.
