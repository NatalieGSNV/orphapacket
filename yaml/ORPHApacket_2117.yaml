    Contents: Hartsfield syndrome is a rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis
      malformation syndrome characterized by the association of variable degrees of
      holoprosencephaly and uni- or bilateral ectrodactyly of the hands and/or feet.
      Additional variable features including facial dysmorphism (e.g. hypertelorism
      short bulbous nose long philtrum dysplastic/low-set ears cleft lip and palate
      tented upper lip) other brain malformations (such as corpus callosum agenesis
      absent septum pellucidum absent olfactory bulbs/tracts vermian hypoplasia) pituitary
      gland-related endocrine disorders (e.g. central diabetes insipidus hypogonadotropic
      hypogonadism) and hypothalamic dysfunction may be associated.
