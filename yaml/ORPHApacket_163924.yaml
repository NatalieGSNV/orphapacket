    Contents: Non-herpetic acute limbic encephalitis is a rare neuroinflammatory/neuroautoimmune
      disease characterized by an acute (or subacute) onset of disturbance of consciousness
      (occasionally presenting as convulsions) and high fever associated with cerebral
      lesions (on magnetic resonance imaging) that are restricted to the limbic system
      (particularly the hippocampi and amygdalae) in the absence of viral bacterial
      fungal paraneoplastic and other disorders.
