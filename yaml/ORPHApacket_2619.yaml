    Contents: Mseleni joint disease (MJD) is a rare and crippling chondrodysplasia
      reported mainly in the Maputaland region in northern Kwazulu Natal South Africa
      characterized by a bilateral and uniform arthropathy of the joints that primarily
      and most severely affects the hip but that can also affect many other joints
      (i.e. knees ankles wrists shoulders elbows) and that manifests with pain and
      stiffness that progressively limits joint movement eventually compromising a
      patient's ability to walk. Severe short staure and brachydactyly have been reported
      in a few patients with MJD.
