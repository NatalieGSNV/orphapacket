    Contents: Tropical pancreatitis is a rare pancreatic disease of juvenile onset
      occurring mainly in tropical developing countries and characterized by chronic
      non-alcoholic pancreatitis manifesting with abdominal pain steatorrhea and fibrocalculous
      pancreatopathy (see this term). It is also commonly associated with the development
      of pancreatic calculi and pancreatic cancer at a much higher frequency than
      seen in ordinary chronic pancreatitis.
