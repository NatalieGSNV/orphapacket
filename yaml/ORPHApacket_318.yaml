  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare unclassified acute myeloid leukemia characterized by a proliferation
      of immature cells exclusively of the erythroid lineage without a significant
      myeloblastic component. Microscopically the cells may be undifferentiated or
      proerythroblastic in appearance. Patients may present with pancytopenia with
      fatigue infections and mucocutaneous bleedings as well as weight loss fever
      and night sweats. Prognosis is poor.
