    Contents: Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare genetically
      heterogeneous disorder of neurogenic brain development characterized by reduced
      head circumference at birth with no gross anomalies of brain architecture and
      variable degrees of intellectual impairment.
