    Contents: Osteogenesis imperfecta type IV is a moderate type of osteogenesis imperfecta
      (OI; see this term) a genetic disorder characterized by increased bone fragility
      low bone mass and susceptibility to bone fractures. Patients with type IV have
      moderately short stature mild to moderate scoliosis grayish or white sclera
      and dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI; see this term).
