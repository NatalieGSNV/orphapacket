  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare benign slowly progressive
      non-inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia of the maxillary and mandibular gingivae
      that generally occurs with the eruption of the permanent (or more rarely the
      primary) dentition or even at birth. It presents as a localized or generalized
      smooth or nodular overgrowth of the gingival tissues of varying severity. It
      can be isolated with autosomal dominant inheritance or as part of a syndrome.
