  TextSection:
    Contents: Inherited acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare malignant hematopologic
      disease characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid blasts primarily involving
      the bone marrow in association with congenital disorders (e.g. Fanconi anemia
      dyskeratosis congenita Bloom syndrome Down syndrome congenital neutropenia neurofibromatosis
      etc.) and genetic defects predisposing to AML. Patients present with signs and
      symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising
      recurrent infections bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement (gingivitis
      splenomegaly etc.). Depending on the underlying genetic defect there may be
      additional cancer risks and other health problems present.
