    Contents: A rare skin disease characterized most typically by targetoid papules
      with concentric color variation symmetrically distributed on the extensor surfaces
      of the extremities accompanied by mucosal involvement (in particular the oral
      mucosa) in the form of initial erythema with edema progressing to superficial
      erosions with pseudomembrane formation. Grouping of lesions around the elbows
      and knees and edema of the nail folds may also be observed. The condition is
      commonly proceeded by prodromal symptoms of malaise fever and myalgias and is
      usually self-limiting although recurrent disease is seen in a subset of patients.
