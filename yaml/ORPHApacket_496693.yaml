  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by a large omphalocele containing liver and small intestine diaphragmatic hernia
      cardiovascular anomalies (e. g. aortic coarctation) variable limb malformations
      (including radioulnar synostosis agenesis of the radius and/or thumb generalized
      syndactyly and numerical reduction of toes) and dysmorphic facial features.
      Additional reported manifestations are unilateral absence of umbilical artery
      intestinal malrotation hypoplastic ovaries and unilateral renal agenesis among
      others. The condition is mostly fatal in the neonatal period.
