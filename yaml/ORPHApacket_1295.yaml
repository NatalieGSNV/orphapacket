  TextSection:
    Contents: Brachytelephalangy - dysmorphism - Kallmann syndrome is a developmental
      anomaly characterized by brachytelephalangy distinct craniofacial features (prominent
      square forehead telecanthus small nose malar hypoplasia smooth philtrum and
      thin upper lip) and relative to other family members a short stature. These
      features may be associated with anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (considered
      as Kallman syndrome ; see this term). Brachytelephalangy - dysmorphism - Kallmann
      syndrome has been described in a mother and her son and there have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1986.
