  TextSection:
    Contents: Infantile Refsum disease (IRD) is the mildest variant of the peroxisome
      biogenesis disorders Zellweger syndrome spectrum (PBD- ZSS; see this term) characterized
      by hypotonia retinitis pigmentosa developmental delay sensorineural hearing
      loss and liver dysfunction. Phenotypic overlap is seen between IRD and neonatal
      adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD) (see this term).
