  TextSection:
    Contents: Cataract - nephropathy - encephalopathy syndrome describes a lethal
      combination of manifestations including short stature congenital cataracts encephalopathy
      with epileptic fits and postmortem confirmation of nephropathy (renal tubular
      necrosis). The combination of cataract - nephropathy - encephalopathy has been
      described in 2 female infant children of first cousin parents. The infants did
      not survive beyond 4 and 8 months respectively. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1963.
