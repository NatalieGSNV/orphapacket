  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by
      a spectrum of clinical hematological and morphological features ranging from
      predominantly myelodysplastic to mainly myeloproliferative in nature. Infiltration
      of the liver spleen lymph nodes and other organs is common. Persistent peripheral
      blood monocytosis with monocytes accounting for more than 10% of leukocytes
      is the hallmark of the condition. Blasts constitute less than 20% of the cells
      in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Other abnormalities are variable. Patients
      may present with constitutional symptoms signs and symptoms of hematopoietic
      insufficiency and hepatosplenomegaly. The disease is associated with a risk
      of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia.
