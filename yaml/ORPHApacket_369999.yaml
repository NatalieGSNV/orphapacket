    Contents: Diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma with painful fissures is a rare genetic
      isolated palmoplantar keratoderma disorder characterized by non-epidermolytic
      diffuse hyperkeratotic lesions affecting both the palms and the soles associated
      with a tendency of painful fissuring. Contrary to the clinical findings histologic
      examination reveals findings suggestive of keratosis palmoplantaris striata
      with orthohyperkeratosis featuring widening of the intercellular spaces and
      disadhesion of keratocytes in the upper epidermal layers.
