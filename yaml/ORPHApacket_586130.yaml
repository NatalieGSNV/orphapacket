  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare sporadic human prion disease characterized by adult onset of
      progredient neurodegeneration presenting as a combination of psychiatric sleep
      and oculomotor disturbances with development of progressive cognitive impairment
      (the predominantly affected cognitive domains being memory temporal and/or spatial
      orientation language executive functions and attention) postural instability
      and sometimes additional motor abnormalities and autonomic hyperactivity in
      the course of the disease. Bilateral thalamic hypometabolism on FDG-PET imaging
      and positive prion seeding activity in the cerebrospinal fluid are present in
      many cases. The disease is fatal within typically two to three years.
