    Contents: Congenital muscular dystrophy with hyperlaxity is a rare genetic neuromuscular
      disease characterized by congenital hypotonia generalized slowly progressive
      muscular weakness and proximal joint contractures with distal joint hypermobility
      and hyperlaxity. Scoliosis or rigidity of the spine and delayed motor milestones
      are also frequently reported. Other manifestations include a long myopathic
      face and in rare cases respiratory failure mild to moderate intellectual deficiency
      and short stature. Ambulation may be impaired with time.
