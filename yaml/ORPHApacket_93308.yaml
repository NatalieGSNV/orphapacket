    Contents: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 1 (MED 1) is a form of multiple epiphyseal
      dysplasia that is characterized by normal or mild short stature pain in the
      hips and/or knees progressive deformity of extremities and early-onset osteoarthrosis.
      Specific features to MED 1 include a more pronounced involvement of hip joints
      and gait abnormality and a shorter adult height. MED1 is allelic to pseudoachondroplasia
      with which it shares clinical and radiological features. The disease follows
      an autosomal dominant mode of transmission.
