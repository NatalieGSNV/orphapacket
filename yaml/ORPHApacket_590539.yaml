  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare nervous system tumor characterized by cells phenotypically representing
      Schwann cells but containing melanosomes and expressing melanoma markers. The
      entity occurs as a non-psammomatous (typically affecting spinal nerves) or a
      psammomatous (also involving nerves of the intestinal tract and heart) variant.
      About 50% of psammomatous tumors are associated with Carney complex. Slightly
      over 10% of melanotic schwannomas follow a malignant course.
