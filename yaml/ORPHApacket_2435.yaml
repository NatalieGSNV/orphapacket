    Contents: Hypo- and hypermelanotic cutaneous macules-retarded growth-intellectual
      disability syndrome is a rare genetic pigmentation anomaly of the skin disorder
      characterized by congenital hypomelanotic and hypermelanotic cutaneous macules
      associated with in some patients retarded growth and intellectual disability.
