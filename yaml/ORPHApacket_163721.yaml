  TextSection:
    Contents: Rolandic epilepsy-speech dyspraxia syndrome is a rare genetic epilepsy
      characterized by speech disorder (including a range of symptoms from dysarthria
      speech dyspraxia receptive and expressive language delay/regression and acquired
      aphasia to subtle impairments of conversational speech) and epilepsy (mostly
      focal and secondary generalized childhood-onset seizures sometimes with aura).
      Mild to severe intellectual disability may also be observed.
