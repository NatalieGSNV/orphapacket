  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-syndromic limb overgrowth characterized by isolated congenital
      enlargement of some or all tissue elements of one or more digits of the hand
      typically within a peripheral nerve territory with the nerve itself being elongated
      as well as increased in diameter. The index finger is most commonly affected.
      If two or more digits are involved these are always adjacent. The enlargement

      range of motion.
