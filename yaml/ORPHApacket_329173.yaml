  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic mixed autoinflammatory and autoimmune syndrome characterized
      by chronic systemic autoinflammation (presenting as recurrent fever in the neonatal
      or infantile period) and combined immunodeficiency (manifesting as recurrent
      viral and invasive bacterial infections). Muscular amylopectinosis may be subclinical
      or be complicated by myopathy/cardiomyopathy.
