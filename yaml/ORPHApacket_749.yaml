  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic coagulation disorder characterized by the usually incidental
      laboratory finding of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
      but normal prothrombin time due to a deficiency of normal prekallikrein or the
      presence of nonfunctional prekallikrein. Most patients remain clinically asymptomatic
      although an association with cardiovascular conditions (hypertension myocardial
      infarction other coronary artery diseases and ischemic strokes) and venous thrombosis
      as well as rare cases with increased bleeding tendency have been reported.
