    Contents: A rare benign superficial fibromatosis disease characterized by single
      or multiple uni- or bilateral fixed slow-growing round firm nodules typically
      located on the medial portion of the plantar aponeurosis with no calcification.
      Patients are often asymptomatic or may present with foot pain difficulty to
      walk or stand and rarely toe contractures. Histopathology reveals dense fibrocellular
      tissue with parallel and nodular arrays of fibrocytes and fibrillar collagen
      with a distinctive cork-screw morphology and no atypia.
