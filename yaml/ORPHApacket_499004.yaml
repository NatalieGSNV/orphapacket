    Contents: A rare bacterial infectious disease caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>
      characterized by a variable clinical picture comprising classic manifestations
      of meningitis i. e. headache fever and stiff neck in addition to cranial nerve
      palsies (most commonly III VI and VII) altered mental status and seizures among
      others. Basal meningeal enhancement in neuroimaging cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities
      (moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis moderately elevated protein concentration
      low glucose) and a chest x-ray suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis may support
      the diagnosis.
