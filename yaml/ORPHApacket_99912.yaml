    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: Malignant dysgerminomatous germ cell tumor of ovary is the most common
      form of malignant germ cell tumor of ovary (see this term) arising from germ
      cells in the ovary usually presenting during adolescence with pelvic mass fever
      vaginal bleeding and acute abdomen and is characterized by bilaterality (around
      10% of cases) association with dysgenetic gonads (5 to 10% of cases) elevated
      serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (in
      the presence of syncitiotrophoblasts). Malignant dysgerminomatous germ cell
      tumor of ovary responds well to chemotherapy potentially sparing patients from
      infertility and early mortality.
