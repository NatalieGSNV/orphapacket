  TextSection:
    Contents: Startle epilepsy is a rare neurologic disease characterized by frequent
      and spontaneous epileptic seizures (frequently with symmetrical or asymmetrical
      tonic features) triggered by a normal startle in response to a sudden and unexpected
      somatosensory (most frequently auditory) stimulus. Falls are common and can
      be traumatic. In most cases the disease is associated with spastic hemi- di-
      or tetraplegia and intellectual disability.
