    Contents: Leukoencephalopathy-thalamus and brainstem anomalies-high lactate (LTBL)
      syndrome is a rare genetic neurological disorder defined by early-onset of neurologic
      symptoms biphasic clinical course unique MRI features (incl. extensive symmetrical
      deep white matter abnormalities) and increased lactate in body fluids. The severe
      form is characterized by delayed psychomotor development seizures early-onset
      hypotonia and persistently increased lactate levels. The mild form usually presents
      with irritability psychomotor regression after six months of age and temporary
      high lactate levels with overall clinical improvement from the second year onward.
