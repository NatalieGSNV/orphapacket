  TextSection:
    Contents: Diaphanospondylodysostosis is characterized by absent ossification of
      the vertebral bodies and sacrum associated with variable anomalies. It has been
      described in less than ten patients from different families. Manifestations
      include a short neck a short wide thorax a reduced number of ribs a narrow pelvis
      and inconstant anomalies such as myelomeningocele cystic kidneys with nephrogenic
      rests and cleft palate.
