  TextSection:
    Contents: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare cardiomyopathy characterized
      anatomically by prominent left ventricular trabeculae and deep intratrabecular
      recesses causing progressive systolic and diastolic dysfunction conduction abnormalities
      and occasionally thromboembolic events.
