  TextSection:
    Contents: Bone dysplasia lethal Holmgren type (BDLH) is a lethal bone dysplasia
      characterized at birth by low birth weight a rhizomelic dwarfism bent femora
      and short chest producing asphyxia. It was described in three siblings from
      healthy non-consanguineous parents of Finnish and in four siblings from non-consanguineous
      parents of French origin with no family history of dwarfism. The initial cases
      could have been diagnosed as Desbuquois syndrome or a recessive Larsen syndrome.
      There has been no further description of BDLH in the literature since 1988.
