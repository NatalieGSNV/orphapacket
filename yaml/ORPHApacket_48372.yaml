  TextSection:
    Contents: Nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver is a rare parenchymatous
      liver disease characterized by diffuse benign transformation of the hepatic
      parenchyma into multiple small nodules (composed of regenerating hepatocytes)
      and that is usually asymptomatic but can lead to the development of non-cirrhotic
      portal hypertension and its complications including esophageal variceal bleeding
      hypersplenism and ascites. It is often associated with rheumatologic autoimmune
      hematologic and myeloproliferative disorders as well as various immune deficiency
      states and exposure certain drugs and toxins.
