    Contents: An autosomal recessively inherited organic aciduria characterized by
      a deficiency in isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase that has wide clinical variability
      and that can present in infancy with acute manifestations of vomiting failure
      to thrive seizures lethargy a characteristic ''sweaty feet'' odor acute pancreatitis
      and mild to severe developmental delay or in childhood with metabolic acidosis
      (brought on by prolonged fasting an increased intake of protein-rich food or
      infections) and that can be fatal if not treated immediately. Chronic intermittent
      presentations and asymptomatic patients have also been reported.
