  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital intrauterine infection-like syndrome is characterised by
      the presence of microcephaly and intracranial calcifications at birth accompanied
      by neurological delay seizures and a clinical course similar to that seen in
      patients after intrauterine infection with Toxoplasma gondii Rubella Cytomegalovirus
      Herpes simplex (so-called TORCH syndrome) or other agents despite repeated tests
      revealing the absence of any known infectious agent.
