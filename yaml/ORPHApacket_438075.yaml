  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of ketone body transport characterized by recurrent
      episodes of ketoacidosis provoked by fasting or infections in the first years
      of life. The episodes are typically preceded by poor feeding and vomiting and
      are associated with dehydration in severe cases also with decreased consciousness
      and insufficient respiratory drive. Hypoglycemia is observed only infrequently.
      Patients with homozygous mutations tend to present at a younger age have more
      profound ketoacidosis and may show mild to moderate developmental delay in addition.
