    Contents: Short stature-craniofacial anomalies-genital hypoplasia syndrome is
      characterized by the association of short stature craniofacial anomalies and
      genital hypoplasia. Intellectual deficit is also found in the majority of cases
      sometimes together with pterygia. Less than 20 cases have been described so
      far. The mode of transmission is likely to be autosomal dominant with incomplete
      penetrance. The syndrome is caused by unbalanced reciprocal translocations of
      the distal parts of chromosomes 6q and 9p leading to partial trisomy of the
      distal region of chromosome 6q and partial monosomy of the distal region of
      chromosome 9p.
