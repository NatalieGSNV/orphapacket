    Contents: A form of diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism (DHI) characterized
      by hypoglycemic episodes that are usually mild escaping detection during infancy
      and usually present a good clinical response to diazoxide. Autosomal dominant
      hyperinsulinism due to SUR1 deficiency usually has a milder phenotype when compared
      to that resulting from recessive K-ATP mutations (recessive forms of Diazoxide-resistant
      hyperinsulinism).
