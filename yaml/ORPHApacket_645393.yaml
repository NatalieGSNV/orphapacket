    Contents: A very rare form of composite dysraphism characterized by the presence
      of a split cord malformation and a myeloschisis on one of the two hemicords.
      Hemicords can be in a single dural sac or in two separated dural sacs. Other
      spinal cord malformations can be associated. Due to the comparable prognosis
      it is considered as a subtype of myeloschisis.
