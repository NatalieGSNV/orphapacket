    Contents: Meckel syndrome (MKS) is a rare lethal genetic multiple congenital anomaly
      disorder characterized by the triad of brain malformation (mainly occipital
      encephalocele) large polycystic kidneys and polydactyly as well as associated
      abnormalities that may include cleft lip/palate cardiac and genital anomalies
      central nervous system (CNS) malformations liver fibrosis and bone dysplasia.
