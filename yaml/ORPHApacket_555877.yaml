  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic cardiac malformation characterized by progressive myxomatous
      degeneration predominantly of the mitral valve (but not uncommonly with multivalvular
      involvement) presenting as valve thickening and dysfunction with variable stenosis
      prolapse and/or regurgitation and potentially resulting in lethal heart failure.
      Hyperextensible skin and joint hypermobility have been reported in some patients.
      Hemizygous males display a more severe phenotype than heterozygous females.
