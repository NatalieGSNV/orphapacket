    Contents: Syndactyly type 8 is a rare genetic non-syndromic congenital limb malformation
      characterized by unilateral or bilateral fusion of the fourth and fifth metacarpals
      with no other associated abnomalities. Patients present shortened fourth and
      fifth metacarpals with excessive separation between their distal ends resulting
      in marked ulnar deviation of the little finger and an inability to bring the
      fifth finger in parallel with the other fingers.
