    Contents: A rare staphylococcal toxemia caused by epidermolytic toxins of <i>Staphylococcus
      aureus</i> and characterized by the appearance of widespread erythematous patches
      on which large blisters develop. Upon rupture of these blisters the skin appears
      reddish and scalded. The lesions typically begin in the face and rapidly expand
      to other parts of the body. The disease may be complicated by pneumonia and
      sepsis. It most commonly affects newborns and infants.
