    Contents: A rare mostly benign primary tumor of the meninges (arachnoid cap cells)
      usually located in the supratentorial compartment commonly appearing in the
      sixth and seventh decade of life clinically silent in most cases or causing
      hyperostosis close to the tumor and resulting in focal bulging and localized
      pain in less than 10% of cases. Additional features may include headache seizures
      gradual personality changes (apathy and dementia) anosmia impaired vision exophthalmos
      hearing loss ataxia dysmetria hypotonia nystagmus and rarely spontaneous bleeding.
