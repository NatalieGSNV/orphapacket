    Contents: A rare form of botulism a rare acquired neuromuscular junction disease
      with descending flaccid paralysis caused by botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) and
      is due to intestinal colonization by <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> leading to
      toxin-mediated infection with toxemia. The disease affects infants (infant botulism)
      and very rarely adults (adult intestinal botulism).
