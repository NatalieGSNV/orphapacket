    Contents: Trigonocephaly-short stature-developmental delay syndrome is characterised
      by short stature trigonocephaly and developmental delay. It has been described
      in three males. Moderate intellectual deficit was reported in one of the males
      and the other two patients displayed psychomotor retardation. X-linked transmission
      has been suggested but autosomal recessive inheritance can not be ruled out.
