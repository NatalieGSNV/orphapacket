    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: A rare neurologic disease characterized by the presence of Duane retraction
      syndrome (i. e. a congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder with unilateral
      or bilateral limitation of abduction and/or adduction of the eye as well as
      globe retraction and palpebral fissure narrowing on attempted adduction) in
      combination with congenital unilateral or bilateral hearing loss. The sidedness
      of hearing loss corresponds to the sidedness of the retraction syndrome.
