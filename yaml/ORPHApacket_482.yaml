  TextSection:
    Contents: Kimura disease is a benign and chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown
      etiology occurring mainly in Asian countries (very rarely in Western countries)
      and predominantly affecting young men that usually presents with solitary or
      multiple non-tender subcutaneous masses in the head and neck region (in particular
      the preauricular and submandibular area) and/or generalized painless lymphadenopathy
      often with salivary gland involvement. Characteristic laboratory findings include
      blood eosinophilia and markedly elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels.
      It is often associated with autoinflammatory disorders (i.e. ulcerative colitis
      bronchial asthma) and a co-existing renal disease.
