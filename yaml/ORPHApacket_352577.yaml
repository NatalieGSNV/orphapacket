    Contents: Severe feeding difficulties-failure to thrive-microcephaly due to ASXL3
      deficiency syndrome is rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability disorder
      with a variable phenotypic presentation typically characterized by microcephaly
      severe feeding difficulties failure to thrive severe global development delay
      that frequently results in absent/poor speech moderate to profound intellectual
      disability hypotonia and a distinctive facies that includes prominent forehead
      high-arched thin eyebrows hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures long
      tubular nose with broad tip and prominent nasal bridge and wide mouth with full
      everted lower lip.
