    Contents: Mendelian susceptibily to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) due to complete
      interferon gamma receptor 2 (IFN-gammaR2) deficiency is a genetic variant of
      MSMD (see this term) characterized by a complete deficiency in IFN-gammaR2 leading
      to an undetectable response to IFN-gamma and consequently to severe and often
      fatal infections with bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) and other environmental
      mycobacteria (EM).
