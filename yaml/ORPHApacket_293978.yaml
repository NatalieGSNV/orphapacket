  TextSection:
    Contents: Deficiency in anterior pituitary function-variable immunodeficiency
      syndrome is a rare genetic endocrine disease characterized by the association
      of common variable immunodeficiency manifesting with hypogammaglobulinemia and
      recurrent or severe childhood-onset sinopulmonary infections followed possibly
      many years later by symptomatic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency
      resulting from anterior pituitary hormone deficiency.
