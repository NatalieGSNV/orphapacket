  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hypersensitivity reaction characterized by the rapid development
      of numerous nonfollicular sterile pinhead-sized pustules on an erythematous
      base predominantly occurring on the trunk intertriginous and flexural areas
      with rare mostly oral mucosal involvement. Fever peripheral blood leukocytosis
      and mild eosinophilia are accompanying features. Systemic involvement with hepatic
      renal or pulmonary dysfunction occasionally occurs. Onset usually occurs 1-12
      days after administration of the causal medication and is most frequently associated
      with beta&#8208;lactam antibiotics macrolides (including pristinamycin and clindamycin)
      diltiazem terbinafine (hydroxy&#8208;)chloroquine but many other medications
      have also been implicated. Histology reveals spongiform subcorneal and/or intraepidermal
      pustules but this pattern is not specific (same in pustular psoriasis).
