  TextSection:
    Contents: Lethal arteriopathy syndrome due to fibulin-4 deficiency is a rare genetic
      vascular disorder characterized by severe aneurysmal dilatation elongation and
      tortuosity of the thoracic aorta its branches and pulmonary arteries with stenosis
      at various typical locations typically resulting in infantile demise. Variable
      associated features may include cutis laxa long philtrum with thin vermillion
