  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic bone development disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal
      growth retardation skeletal anomalies such as arachnodactyly and bilateral talipes
      equinovarus joint contractures with camptodactyly dysmorphic facial features
      (including midface hypoplasia or micrognathia) and abnormalities of the anterior
      segment of the eye. Skeletal imaging may show diffuse osteopenia and multiple
      fractures. The syndrome is lethal within the first year of life.
