    Contents: A rare genetic movement disorder characterized by early-onset very slowly
      progressive choreiform movements that may involve variable parts of the body
      typically aggravated by stress or anxiety in various members of a family. Additional
      variable manifestations include hypotonia often resulting in psychomotor delay
      (including gait disturbances) and dysarthria as well as myoclonus dystonia behavioral
      symptoms (ADHD obsessive-compulsive disorder) learning difficulties (particularly
      in writing) and spasticity with hyperreflexia and/or flexor/extensor plantar
