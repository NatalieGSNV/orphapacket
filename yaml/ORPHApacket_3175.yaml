    Contents: This syndrome is characterised by myoclonic epilepsy with generalised
      spasticity and intellectual deficit. It has been described in six males from
      two generations of one family. Transmission appears to be X-linked recessive
      and the syndrome is caused by mutations in the aristaless-related homeobox gene
      (<I>ARX</I> Xp22.13).
