  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic central nervous system malformation characterized by
      dysplasia of the superior cerebellum (especially the vermis) brainstem asymmetry
      dysplasia of the basal ganglia and cortical irregularities with asymmetric abnormalities
      in gyral size and orientation as well as varying sulcal depth but without lissencephaly
      pachygyria or polymicrogyria. Clinically patients present global developmental
      delay with motor development usually being more affected that speech. Variable
      features are abnormal eye movements including oculomotor apraxia strabismus
      seizures and behavioral problems.
