    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: Hypertrichosis-acromegaloid facial appearance syndrome (HAFF) is a very
      rare multiple congenital abnormality syndrome manifesting from birth with progressive
      hypertrichosis congenita terminalis (thick scalp hair extending onto the forehead
      with generalized increased body hair) associated with a typical acromegaloid
      facial appearance (thick eyebrows prominent supraorbital ridges broad nasal
      bridge anteverted nares long and large philtrum and prominent mouth with full
      lips) appearing during childhood. HAFF seems to belong to a spectrum of phenotypes
      with the clinically overlapping acromegaloid facial appearance syndrome and
      hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia CantÃ¹ type (see these terms).
