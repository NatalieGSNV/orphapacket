  TextSection:
    Contents: "Hypertrichosis-acromegaloid facial appearance syndrome (HAFF) is a\
      \ very rare multiple congenital abnormality syndrome manifesting from birth\
      \ with progressive hypertrichosis congenita terminalis (thick scalp hair extending\
      \ onto the forehead with generalized increased body hair) associated with a\
      \ typical acromegaloid facial appearance (thick eyebrows prominent supraorbital\
      \ ridges broad nasal bridge anteverted nares long and large philtrum and prominent\
      \ mouth with full lips) appearing during childhood. HAFF seems to belong to\
      \ a spectrum of phenotypes with the clinically overlapping acromegaloid facial\
      \ appearance syndrome and hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia Cant\xF9 type\
      \ (see these terms)."
