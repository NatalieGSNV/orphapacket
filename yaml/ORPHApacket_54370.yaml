    Contents: Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a chronic progressive
      kidney disorder characterized by glomerular capillary wall structural changes
      and mesangial cell proliferation leading to nephrotic syndrome hypocomplementemia
      hypertension proteinuria and end-stage kidney disease. MPGN can be due to either
      idiopathic (type 1 2 and 3 MPGN; see these terms) or secondary (associated with
      infectious and immune complex diseases) causes.
