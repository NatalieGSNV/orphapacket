    Contents: Isolated complex III deficiency is a rare genetic mitochondrial oxidative
      phosphorylation disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations
      ranging from isolated myopathy or transient hepatopathy to severe multisystem
      disorder (that may include hypotonia failure to thrive psychomotor delay cardiomyopathy
      encephalopathy renal tubulopathy hearing impairment lactic acidosis hypoglycemia
      and other signs and symptoms).
