  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hematologic neoplasm characterized by origin from precursors
      of plasmacytoid dendritic cells with frequent cutaneous bone marrow and lymph
      node involvement as well as leukemic dissemination. Most common clinical presentation
      is with asymptomatic solitary or multiple skin lesions (either isolated purplish
      nodules isolated bruise-like papules or disseminated purplish nodules/macules/papules)
      although some patients may present with leukemia. Skin biopsy shows a diffuse
      monomorphous infiltrate of medium-sized blast cells resembling either lymphoblasts
      or myeloblasts with massive involvement of the dermis. The clinical course is
      aggressive and age has an adverse impact on prognosis.
