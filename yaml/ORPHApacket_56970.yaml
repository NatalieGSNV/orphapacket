  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation
      of prions abnormal variants of the cellular prion protein primarily in brain
      tissue of affected individuals as well as massive rapid neuronal death and an
      invariably fatal course. Human prion diseases most often occur sporadically
      but may also be of genetic origin or infectiously acquired. Irrespective of
      etiology they are transmissible to other individuals.
