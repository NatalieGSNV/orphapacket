    Contents: Prion diseases are a group of rare transmissible disorders characterized
      by progressive debilitating neurological manifestations due to spongiform changes
      with an invariably fatal course. The disorders all involve accumulation of an
      abnormal prion protein in the central nervous system with no specific immunological
      response. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD; see this term) is the most
      frequent form accounting for about 85% of prion disease cases. The other forms
      of prion disease are genetic (5-15%) and include inherited CJD fatal familial
      insomnia (FFI) and Familial Alzheimer-like prion disease (see these terms).
      Acquired forms (< 5%) include iatrogenic CJD and variant CJD (vCDJ).
