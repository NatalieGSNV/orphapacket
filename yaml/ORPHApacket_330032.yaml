    Contents: A rare beta-thalassemia associated with another hemoglobin anomaly characterized
      by the presence of the hemoglobin Lepore variant in association with beta-thalassemia.
      Clinical presentation is highly variable depending on the type of beta-thalassemia
      and ranges from severe hypochromic microcytic anemia and complete transfusion
      dependency to moderate compensated anemia without a need for regular blood transfusions.
