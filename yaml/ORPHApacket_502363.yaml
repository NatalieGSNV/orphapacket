  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare head and neck tumor characterized by a firm infiltrative neoplasm
      with squamous differentiation arising from the mucosal epithelium and most commonly
      located in the tongue floor of the mouth or gingiva but also the buccal mucosa
      or any other area of the oral cavity depending on prevailing risk factors (such
      as smoking alcohol consumption and tobacco chewing). Patients present with a
      variably white erythematous mixed nodular or ulcerated lesion which may cause
      discomfort pain or reduced mobility of the tongue. The tumor is aggressive with
      a propensity for local invasion and early lymph node metastasis.
