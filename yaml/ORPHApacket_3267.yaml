    Contents: Familial lambdoid synostosis is a rare genetic cranial malformation
      characterized by unilateral or bilateral synostosis of the lambdoid suture in
      multiple members of a single family. Unilateral cases typically present ipsilateral
      occipitomastoid bulge compensatory contralateral parietal and frontal bossing
      displacement of one ear lateral deviation of jaw and compensatory deformation
      of cervical spine while bilateral cases usually manifest with flat and widened
      occiput displacement of both ears and frequent occurrence of raised intracranial
      pressure.
