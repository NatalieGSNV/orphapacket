    Contents: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 4 is a multiple epiphyseal dysplasia
      with a late-childhood onset characterized by joint pain involving hips knees
      wrists and fingers with occasional limitation of joint movements deformity of
      hands feet and knees (club foot clinodactyly brachydactyly) scoliosis and slightly
      reduced adult height. Radiographs display flat epiphyses with early arthritis
      of the hip and double-layered patella. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 4
      follows an autosomal recessive mode of transmission. The disease is allelic
      to diastrophic dwarfism atelosteogenesis type 2 and achondrogenesis type 1B
      with whom it forms a clinical continuum.
