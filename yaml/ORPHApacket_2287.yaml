  TextSection:
    Contents: Fused manidbular incisors is an extremely rare dental anomaly that is
      characterized by the union of two normally separated incisor tooth germs of
      the primary dentition. It is frequently associated with hypodontia (see this
      term) and an increased risk of pulp exposure.
