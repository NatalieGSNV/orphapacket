  TextSection:
    Contents: Borderline epithelial tumor of the ovary is an uncommon epithelial ovarian
      neoplasm distinguished from ovarian carcinomas by the absence of destructive
      stromal invasion generally characterized by indolent behavior and excellent
      prognosis. Most patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and the symptoms
      if present are often nonspecific and vague such as pelvic pain abdominal mass
      or rarely gastrointestinal problems including early satiety or bloating. Six
      histological subtypes are currently recognized based on the epithelial cell
      type.
