    Contents: A rare epithelial ovarian neoplasm distinguished from ovarian carcinomas
      by the absence of destructive stromal invasion generally characterized by indolent
      behavior and excellent prognosis. Most patients are asymptomatic at the time
      of diagnosis and the symptoms if present are often nonspecific and vague such
      as pelvic pain abdominal mass or rarely gastrointestinal problems including
      early satiety or bloating. Six histological subtypes are currently recognized
      based on the epithelial cell type.
