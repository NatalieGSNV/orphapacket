    Contents: FASTKD2-related infantile mitochondrial encephalomyopathy is a rare
      genetic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized by infantile-onset
      encephalomyopathy presenting with developmental delay slowly progressive hemiplegia
      intractable epileptic seizures and asymmetrical brain atrophy with dilatation
      of the ipsilateral ventricle system. Additional features include optic atrophy
      mildly increased plasma and/or CSF lactate and decreased cytochrome c oxidase
      acitivity in skeletal muscle biopsy.
