  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare respiratory tumor characterized by an aggressive malignant dysontogenetic
      neoplasm of intrathoracic (pulmonary pleural or combined) mesenchyme occurring
      in young children. Three subtypes can be distinguished type 1 being purely cystic
      type 2 cystic and solid and type 3 purely solid. Type 1 lesions may progress
      to the more malignant types 2 and 3 which are associated with central nervous
      system and bone metastasis. The tumor is often part of pleuropulmonary blastoma
      family tumor and dysplasia syndrome. It can also be associated with multilocular
      cystic nephroma or other neoplasms. Patients usually present with dyspnea or
      other respiratory problems and sometimes pneumothorax.
