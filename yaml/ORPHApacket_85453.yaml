  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder is an extremely rare skin disease
      described in only four families to date and characterized in males by diffuse
      reticulate brown hyperpigmentated skin lesions developing in early childhood
      and a variety of systemic manifestations (recurrent pneumonia corneal opacification
      gastrointestinal inflammation urethral stricture failure to thrive hypohidrosis
      digital clubbing and unruly hair and flared eyebrows) while in females there
      is only cutaneous involvement with the development in early childhood of localized
      brown hyperpigmented skin lesions following the lines of Blaschko. This disease
      was first considered as a cutaneous amyloidosis but amyloid deposits are an
      inconstant feature.
