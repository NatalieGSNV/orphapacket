  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary lymphedema characterized by unilateral or bilateral
      lower limb lymphedema of variable severity. The condition shows almost complete
      penetrance with onset in childhood or adolescence in females whereas in males
      it shows incomplete penetrance with later onset of disease. Lymphoscintigraphy
      in more severely affected individuals reveals lymphatic abnormalities consistent
      with lymphangiectasia valve dysfunction and thoracic duct reflux.
