    Contents: A rare genetic cerebral small vessel disease characterized by leukoencephalopathy
      and cerebral calcification and cysts due to diffuse cerebral microangiopathy
      resulting in microcystic and macrocystic parenchymal degeneration. The condition
      can present at any age from early childhood to late adulthood and manifests
      as a progressive cerebral degeneration. Symptoms are variable but restricted
      to the central nervous systems and include among others slowing of cognitive
      performance seizures and movement disorder with a combination of pyramidal extrapyramidal
      and cerebellar features.
