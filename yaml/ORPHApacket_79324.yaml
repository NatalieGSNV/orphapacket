  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation characterized
      by facial dysmorphism (prominent forehead large ears thin upper lip) generalized
      hypotonia feeding difficulties moderate to severe developmental delay progressive
      microcephaly frequent upper respiratory tract infections due to impaired immunity
      with decreased immunoglobulin levels and decreased coagulation factors. Additional
      features include hypogonadism with or without hypospadias in males skeletal
      anomalies seizures and cardiac anomalies in some cases. The disease is caused
      by loss of function mutations of the gene <i>ALG12</i> (22q13.33).
