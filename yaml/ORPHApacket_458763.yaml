  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular tumor characterized by a slowly growing lesion with
      predominant involvement of the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the distal extremities.
      Distinctive arborizing blood vessels lined by endothelial cells with characteristic
      hobnail morphology are a typical feature. Local recurrences are frequent unless
      wide local excision is performed while metastasis is rare.
