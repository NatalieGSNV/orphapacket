  TextSection:
    Contents: Peeling skin syndrome (PSS) refers to a group of rare autosomal recessive
      forms of ichthyosis (see this term) that is characterized clinically by superficial
      asymptomatic spontaneous peeling of the skin and histologically by a shedding
      of the outer layers of the epidermis. PSS presents with either an acral (acral
      PSS) or a generalized distribution (generalized PSS type A (non inflammatory)
      or B (inflammatory)) (see these terms). Some cases remain difficult to classify
      suggesting that there could be additional subtypes of PSS.
