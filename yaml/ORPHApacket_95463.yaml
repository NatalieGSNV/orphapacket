  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare congenital tricuspid malformations characterized by
      anomalies of the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles including aberrant
      chordae tendineae straddling valve (abnormal attachment of the chordae tendineae
      to both ventricles) and parachute valve (unifocal attachment of the chordae
      tendineae to a single or fused papillary muscle) resulting in an incompetent
      valve with regurgitation and/or stenosis and impaired right ventricular inflow
      potentially leading to heart failure. In most cases other cardiac anomalies
      are found in association.
