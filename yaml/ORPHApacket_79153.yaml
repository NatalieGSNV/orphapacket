  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare isolated nail anomaly characterized by brittle thin rough opaque
      appearing nails with excessive longitudinal ridging. In a less severe form the
      nails retain their luster and present with superficial ridging and multiple
      small geometric pits. In both varieties superficial scaling of the nail plate
      and hyperkeratosis of the cuticles as well as koilonychia and onychoschizia
      are observed. Any number of nails may be affected and fingernails are more often
      affected than toenails. Spontaneous improvement of the condition may occur.
