  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital absence/hypoplasia of thumb is a rare developmental defect
      during embryogenesis characterized by underdevelopment of the thumb ranging
      from a slight decrease in thumb size to complete absence of the thumb. The malformation
      may occur isolated combined to other defects of the hand or upper limb or as
      part of a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome.
