  TextSection:
    Contents: Brachydactyly - arterial hypertension is a rare genetic brachydactyly
      syndrome characterized by the association of brachydactyly type E (see this
      term) with hypertension (due to vascular or neurovascular anomalies) as well
      as the additional features of short stature and low birth weight (compared to
      non-affected family members) stocky build and a round face. The onset of hypertension
      is often in childhood and if untreated most patients will have had a stroke
      by the age of 50.
