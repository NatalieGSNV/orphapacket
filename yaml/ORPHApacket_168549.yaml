  TextSection:
    Contents: Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia is a rare type of spondylometaphyseal
      dysplasia characterized by metaphyseal changes of the truncal-juxtatruncal bones
      associated with retinal dystrophy. Patients typically present progressive postnatal
      growth failure with rhizomelic shortening of the limbs a deformed hypoplastic
      thorax and retinitis pigmentosa or pigmentary retinal degeneration. Radiographic
      findings include short ribs with flared cupped anterior ends mild platyspondyly
      lacy ilia and metaphyseal dysplasia of the proximal femora.
