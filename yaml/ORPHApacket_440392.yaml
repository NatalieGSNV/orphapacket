  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic interstitial lung disease characterized by diffuse lung
      disease of variable phenotype ranging from severe respiratory insufficiency
      in infancy to asymptomatic adults due to surfactant protein C deficiency. Typical
      presentation in infancy includes dyspnea cough wheezing and gradual cyanosis
      with or without failure to thrive. Radiological findings include diffuse ground-glass
      opacities in neonates later interstitial thickening associated with lung hyperinflation
      intraparenchymal/subpleural cysts honeycombing subpleural nodules or bronchiectasis.
      Infiltrates and air leaks are frequent complications.
