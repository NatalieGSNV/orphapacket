    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: A rare group of acquired lipodystrophies that are characterized by loss
      of subcutaneous tissue from generally small regions of the body either single
      or multiple areas and are not typically associated with metabolic complications.
      Some cases may involve lipohypertrophy (insulin). This group includes pressure-induced
      localized lipoatrophy drug-induced localized lipodystrophy panniculitis- induced
      localized lipodystrophy centrifugal lipodystrophy and idiopathic localized lipodystrophy.
