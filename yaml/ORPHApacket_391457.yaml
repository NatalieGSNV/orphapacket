  TextSection:
    Contents: HSD10 disease neonatal type is the most severe form of HSD10 disease
      a rare neurometabolic disorder. It is characterized by severe metabolic/lactic
      acidosis in the neonatal period little psychomotor development seizures and
      severe progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hepatic involvement and coagulopathy
      are rare. The disease is fatal within the first months of life.
