    Contents: A rare acquired skeletal muscle disease characterized by severe weakness
      of the neck extensor muscles causing progressive reducible kyphosis of the cervical
      spine and the inability to hold the head up in the absence of a known cause.
      Histological studies reveal a non-inflammatory myopathic picture. The clinical
      course is relatively benign although cervical myelopathy may develop.
