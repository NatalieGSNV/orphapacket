    Contents: Immunodeficiency due to a late component of complement deficiency is
      a primary immunodeficiency due to an anomaly in either complement components
      C5 C6 C7 C8 or C9 and is typically characterized by meningitis due to often
      recurrent meningococcal infections. The prognosis is generally favorable.
