  TextSection:
    Contents: Hemimelia is a limb malformation characterized by the absence or gross
      shortening of the lower portion of one or more of the limbs. The condition is
      designated according to which bone of the distal arm or leg is absent or defective
      and includes fibular radial tibial or ulnar hemimelia (see these terms). Hemimelia
      ranges in severity.
