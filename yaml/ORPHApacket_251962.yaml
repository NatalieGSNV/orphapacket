  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mixed neuronal-glial tumor characterized by a supratentorial
      space-occupying lesion in periventricular location often with prominent cystic
      change. The histological hallmark of this low-grade neoplasm is its pseudopapillary
      appearance with a single layer of cuboidal cells around hyalinized blood vessels
      associated with sheets or focal collections of neuronal cells. Clinical presentation
      is variable and non-specific most frequently with headache and seizures. Prognosis
      is favorable after complete resection.
