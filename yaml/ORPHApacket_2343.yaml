  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of craniosynostosis involving multiple sutures (coronal lambdoidal
      sagittal and metopic) characterized by a trilobular skull of varying severity
      (frontal towering and bossing temporal bulging and a flat posterior skull) dysmorphic
      features (downslanting palpebral fissures midface hypoplasia and extreme proptosis)
      and that is complicated by hydrocephalus cerebral venous hypertension developmental
      delay/intellectual disability and hind brain herniation.
