  TextSection:
    Contents: Peripheral motor neuropathy-dysautonomia syndrome is characterised by
      distal slowly progressive muscular weakness childhood-onset amyotrophy autonomic
      dysfunction characterized by profuse sweating distal cyanosis related to cold
      weather orthostatic hypotension and esophageal achalasia. It has been described
      in two sisters. Inheritance appears to be autosomal recessive.
