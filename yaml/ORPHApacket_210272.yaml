    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: Mal de débarquement (MdD) is a rare otorhinolaryngological disease characterized
      by a persistent sensation of motion such as rocking swaying tumbling and/or
      bobbing following a period of exposure to passive movement usually an ocean
      cruise or other types of water train automobile or air travel and less commonly
      other movements (like sleeping on a waterbed). Onset may be spontaneous in some
      patients. Manifestations begin shortly after the stimulus persist for 6 months
      to years and may be associated with anxiety fatigue and impaired cognition.
      Symptoms are often accentuated when in an enclosed space or when attempting
      to be motionless (sitting lying down or standing in a stationary position) and
      are relieved when in passive motion such as in a moving car airplane or train.
