  TextSection:
    Contents: Multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome is a rare genetic vascular
      disease characterized by congenital dysfunction of smooth muscle throughout
      the body manifesting with cerebrovascular disease aortic anomalies intestinal
      hypoperistalsis hypotonic bladder and pulmonary hypertension. Congenital mid-dilated
      pupils non-reactive to light associated with a large persistent patent ductus
      arteriosus are characteristic hallmarks of the disease.
