  TextSection:
    Contents: A plasma cell disorder characterized by the aggregation and deposition
      of insoluble amyloid fibrils derived from misfolding of monoclonal immunoglobulin
      light chains usually produced by a plasma cell tumor. It usually presents as
      primary systemic amyloidosis (PSA) with multiple organ involvement and less
      frequently as primary localized amyloidosis (PLA) restricted to a single organ.
