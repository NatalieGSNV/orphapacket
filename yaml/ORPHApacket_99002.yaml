    Contents: A rare patterned dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium of progressive
      course characterized by the presence of a bilateral hyperpigmented reticular
      pattern resembling a fishnet with knots resulting in a slowly progressive loss
      of vision that often only becomes apparent in old age. This disorder is sometimes
      associated with scleral staphyloma choroidal neovascularization convergent strabismus
      spherophakia with myopia and luxated lenses and partial atrophy of the iris.
