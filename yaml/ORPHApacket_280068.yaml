  TextSection:
    Contents: Visceral calciphylaxis is a rare life-threatening non-inflammatory vasculopathy
      disorder characterized by diffuse precipitation of calcium in viscera (mainly
      in the heart or lungs but also in the stomach or kidneys) leading to fibrosis
      and thrombosis which eventually cause necrotic ulcerations of the tissue. Patients
      may present with dyspnea cough and respiratory failure or acute heart block
      and subsequent sudden cardiac death depending on the affected organ. The disease
      mainly affects patients on dialysis or patients having undergone renal transplantation.
