  TextSection:
    Contents: Complement component 3 deficiency is a rare genetic primary immunodeficiency
      characterized by susceptibility to infection (mainly by gram negative bacteria)
      due to extremely low C3 plasma levels. Patients typically present recurrent
      episodes of sinusitis tonsillitis and/or otitis as well as upper and lower respiratory
      tract infections (including pneumonia) and skin infections such as erythema
      multiforme. Autoimmune disease resembling systemic lupus erythematosus and mesangiocapillary
      or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis may develop resulting in renal failure.
