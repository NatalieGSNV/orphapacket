    Contents: Cervical hypertrichosis peripheral neuropathy is a rare syndrome characterized
      by the association of congenital hypertrichosis in the anterior cervical region
      with peripheral sensory and motor neuropathy. It has been described in three
      members of the same family and in one unrelated boy. Associated features in
      the familial cases include retinal anomalies spina bifida kyphoscoliosis and
      hallux valgus while that in the non-familial case includes developmental delay.
      An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is suggested. There have been no
      further descriptions in the literature since 1993.
