  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare tumors characterized by predominantly neuroendocrine
      differentiation potentially arising in most organs of the body including the
      central nervous system respiratory tract larynx gastrointestinal tract thyroid
      skin breast and urogenital system. The gastrointestinal tract and lungs are
      the most common primary tumor sites. Based on clinical behavior histology and
      proliferation rate the tumors may be categorized as well differentiated (low
      grade to intermediate grade) neuroendocrine tumors and poorly differentiated
      (high grade) neuroendocrine carcinomas. They may or may not be associated with
      clinical hormone hypersecretion syndromes.
