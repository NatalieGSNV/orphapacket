  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial isolated trichomegaly is a rare genetic hair anomaly characterized
      by a prolonged anagen phase of the eyelash hairs leading to extreme eyelash
      growth that may result in corneal irritation. Increased growth of hair on other
      parts of the face (eyebrows cheeks forehead) and/or the body (chest arms legs)
      may be associated.
