    Contents: Bothnia retinal dystrophy is a rare form of retinal dystrophy seen mostly
      in Northern Sweden presenting in early childhood with night blindness and progressive
      maculopathy with a decrease in visual acuity eventually leading to blindness
      by adulthood. Retinal degeneration without obvious bone spicule formation accompanied
      by affected visual fields and the typical presence of retinitis punctata albescens
      (see this term) in the posterior pole are also noted.
