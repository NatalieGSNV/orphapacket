  TextSection:
    Contents: Patent ductus arteriosus - bicuspid aortic valve - hand anomalies syndrome
      is a very rare heart-hand syndrome (see this term) that is characterized by
      a variety of cardiovascular anomalies including patent arterial duct bicuspid
      aortic valve and pseudocoarctation of the aorta in conjunction with hand anomalies
      such as brachydactyly and ulnar ray derivative i.e. fifth metacarpal hypoplasia.
      Transmission is most likely autosomal dominant.
