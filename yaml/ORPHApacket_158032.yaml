      and a potentially life-threatening disorder characterized by cytokine storm
      and overwhelming inflammation causing fever hepatosplenomegaly cytopenia hypertriglyceridemia
      hyperferritinemia and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow liver spleen or lymph
      nodes. It can be either primary due to a genetic defect (primary hemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis ; see this term) or secondary to malignancies to infections
      most commonly with viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus human
      immunodeficiency virus or to autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus
