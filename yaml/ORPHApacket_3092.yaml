  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Fixed subaortic stenosis (FSS) is a rare heart malformation characterized
      by the obstruction by membranous or fibromuscular tissue of the left ventricular
      outflow tract (LVOT) below the aortic valve that occurs as an isolated lesion
      or in association with additional cardiac malformations (e.g. ventricular septal
      defect patent ductus arteriosus coarctation of the aorta) that presents in childhood
      with signs of LVOT obstruction (e.g. dyspnea chest pain syncope palpitations)
      and that can potentially lead to life-threatening complications (e.g. aortic
      regurgitation infective endocarditis). It comprises three anatomical subforms:
      discrete fixed membranous subaortic stenosis (membranous tissue encircling the
      LVOT) discrete fibromuscular subaortic stenosis (fibromuscular tissue encircling
      the LVOT) and tunnel subaortic stenosis (fibromuscular diffuse tunnel-like narrowing
      of the LVOT) the two latter forms being generally more severe than the membranous
      form.'
