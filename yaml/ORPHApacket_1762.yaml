    Contents: Distal Xq duplications refer to chromosomal disorders resulting from
      involvement of the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq). Clinical manifestations
      vary widely depending on the gender of the patient and on the gene content of
      the duplicated segment. The prevalence of Xq duplications remains unknown.
