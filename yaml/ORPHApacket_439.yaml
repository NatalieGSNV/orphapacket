  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated right ventricular hypoplasia (IRVH) is a rare congenital heart
      malformation (see this term) characterized by underdevelopment of the right
      ventricle associated with patent foramen ovale or interauricular communication
      (see these terms) and normally developed tricuspid and pulmonary valves. IRVH
      manifests with severe cyanosis congestive heart failure and in severe cases
      death in early infancy.
