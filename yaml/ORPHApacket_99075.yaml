  TextSection:
    Contents: Encircling double aortic arch is a very rare congenital anomaly of the
      great arteries characterized by the presence of two aortic arches (right and
      left) which encircle and compress the trachea and esophagus resulting in various
      respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. harsh breathing stridor dyspnea
      cyanotic and choking episodes chronic cough recurrent respiratory tract infections
      dysphagia and reflux). Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula have
      also been reported. It usually occurs isolated but on occasion may be associated
      with other congenital heart anomalies and chromosomal aberations.
