  TextSection:
    Contents: "Rieger's anomaly is a congenital ocular defect caused by anterior segment\
      \ dysgenesis and is characterized by severe anterior chamber deformity with\
      \ prominent strands and marked atrophy of the iris stroma with hole or pseudo-hole\
      \ formation and corectopia. The term covers the association of these iris and\
      \ pupil anomalies with the features of Axenfeld\x92s anomaly (see this term)."
