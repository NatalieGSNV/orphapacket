    Contents: A rare idiopathic interstitial pneumonia characterized by extensive
      diffuse intra-alveolar accumulation of pigment-laden macrophages most commonly
      associated with long-term exposure to tobacco smoke. Patients present with slowly
      progressive shortness of breath on exertion and chronic cough with bilateral
      crackles. Digital clubbing is also frequently observed. Pulmonary function test
