  TextSection:
    Contents: Progressive microcephaly-seizures-cortical blindness-developmental delay
      syndrome is a rare genetic neuro-ophthalmological syndrome characterized by
      post-natal progressive microcephaly and early-onset seizures associated with
      delayed global development bilateral cortical visual impairment and moderate
      to severe intellectual disability. Additional manifestations include short stature
      generalized hypotonia and pulmonary complications such as recurrent respiratory
      infections and bronchiectasis. Auditory and metabolic screenings are normal.
