    Contents: Growth hormone insensitivity syndrome (GHIS) is a group of diseases
      characterized by marked short stature associated with normal or elevated growth
      hormone (GH) concentrations which fail to respond to exogenous GH administration.
      GHIS comprises growth delay due to IGF-1 deficiency growth delay due to IGF-1
      resistance Laron syndrome short stature due to STAT5b deficiency and primary
      acid-labile subunit (ALS) deficiency (see these terms).
