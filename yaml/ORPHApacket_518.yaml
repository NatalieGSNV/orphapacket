  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute myeloid leukemia that occurs predominantly in childhood
      and particularly in children with Down syndrome (DS-AMKL). Nonspecific symptoms
      may be irritability weakness and dizziness while specific symptoms include pallor
      fever mucocutaneous bleeding hepatosplenomegaly neurological manifestations
      and rarely lymphadenopathy. Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis may also be
      associated with AMKL. In contrast to DS-AMKL (around 80 % survival) non-DS-AMKL
      is an AML subgroup associated with poor prognosis.
