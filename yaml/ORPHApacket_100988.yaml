  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of hereditary spastic paraplegia which usually presents
      in late adolescence or early adulthood as a pure phenotype of lower limb spasticity
      with hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses as well as mild bladder disturbances
      and pes cavus. Rarely it can present as a complex phenotype with additional
      manifestations including epilepsy variable peripheral neuropathy and/or memory
      impairment.
