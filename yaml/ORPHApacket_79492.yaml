    Contents: Pili gemini defines a situation where the papilla's tip of a hair follicle
      splits during the anagen phase and consequently grows two hair shafts emerging
      through a single pilary canal. A papilla tip that divides in several tips will
      produce several hair shafts a situation named pili multigemini. Pili gemini
      or multigemini can occur in each type of hair.
