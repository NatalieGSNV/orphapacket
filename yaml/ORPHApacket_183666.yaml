  TextSection:
    Contents: Hyper-IgM syndrome without susceptibility to opportunistic infections
      is a rare genetic primary immunodeficiency due to a defect in adaptive immunity
      disorder characterized by normal or elevated IgM serum levels with low or absent
      IgG IgA and IgE serum concentrations which manifests with recurrent bacterial
      sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections with frequent lymphoid hyperplasia
      (peripheral lymphadenopathy tonsillar hypertrophy) with no increased susceptibility
      to opportunistic infections. Autoimmune manifestations (including immune cytopenias
      arthritis and hepatitis) are occasionally associated. Immunologic findings reveal
      absent immunoglobulin class switch recombination and lack of defect of immunoglobulin
      somatic hypermutations in the presence of normal numbers of CD27+ memory B cells.
