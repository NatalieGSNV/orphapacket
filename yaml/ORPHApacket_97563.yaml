  TextSection:
    Contents: Pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (GN) with antineutrophil cytoplasmic
      antibodies (ANCA) is a form of rapidly progressive GN comprising about 90% of
      pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (see this term) and associated with the presence
      of circulating ANCA (mostly directed against proteinase-3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase
      (MPO)). Patients usually present with hematuria and rapidly declining renal
      function often leading to dialysis within weeks without treatment. Cutaneous
      pulmonary musculoskeletal and nervous involvement may be observed in case of
      systemic disease and the correlation between ANCA titer and disease activity
      has been demonstrated.
