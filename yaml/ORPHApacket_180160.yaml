      \ or incomplete transverse septum at any level of the vagina (most frequently\

      llerian duct component and the urogenital sinus component of the vagina during\
      \ embryogenesis. The condition is only rarely diagnosed in neonates or infants\
      \ unless it causes significant hydromucocolpos. Complete septa present with\
      \ primary amenorrhea cyclic pelvic pain dyspareunia or a pelvic mass consisting\
