  TextSection:
    Contents: Hypermethioninemia due to methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency
      is a very rare metabolic disorder resulting in isolated hepatic hypermethioninemia
      that is usually benign due to partial inactivation of enzyme activity. Rarely
      patients have been found to have an odd odor or neurological disorders such
      as brain demyelination.
