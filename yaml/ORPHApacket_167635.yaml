    Contents: A rare lichen myxedematosus characterized by a progressive generalized
      papular sclerodermoid cutaneous eruption usually occurring in association with
      monoclonal gammopathy but in the absence of thyroid disease. Histological hallmark
      is the triad of dermal mucin deposition fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis.
      Patients present with relatively sudden onset of numerous closely spaced waxy
      firm papules and plaques predominantly involving the head neck trunk and dorsal
      aspects of the extremities on the background of thickened edematous erythematous
      skin with sclerodermoid appearance. Systemic involvement with cardiovascular
      gastrointestinal pulmonary musculoskeletal renal or nervous system complications
      is common.
