  TextSection:
    Contents: Hydatidosis or cyst hydatic disease is a cosmopolitan larval cestodosis
      caused principally by the <i>Echinococcus granulosus</i> tapeworm the adult
      form of which parasitises the intestine of dogs. Hydatidosis generally affects
      large domestic herbivores; humans are dead-end hosts infected through contact
      with herding dogs or through ingestion of food contaminated with canine excrement.
