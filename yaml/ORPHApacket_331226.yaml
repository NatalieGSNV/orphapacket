  TextSection:
    Contents: Susceptibility to infection due to TYK2 deficiency is a rare primary
      immunodeficiency characterized by increased susceptibility to intracellular
      bacterial and viral infection with or without increased serum IgE. Clinical
      manifestations are highly variable depending on the infection type and location
      and can include recurrent otitis sinusitis pulmonary and cutaneous infections
      meningitis and internal abscesses.
