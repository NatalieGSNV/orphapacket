    Contents: Potocki-Shaffer syndrome is characterized by multiple exostoses parietal
      foramina enlargement of the anterior fontanelle and occasionally intellectual
      deficit and mild cranio-facial anomalies. To date 23 individuals from 14 families
      have been reported. The syndrome is caused by contiguous gene deletions on the
      short arm of chromosome 11 (11p11.2).
