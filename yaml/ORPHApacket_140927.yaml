  TextSection:
    Contents: Benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures (BFNIS) is a benign familial
      epilepsy syndrome with an intermediate phenotype between benign familial neonatal
      seizures (BFNS) and benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS; see these terms).
      So far this syndrome has been described in multiple members of 10 families.
      Age of onset in these BFNIS families varied from 2 days to 6 months with spontaneous
      resolution in most cases before the age of 12 months. Like BFNS and BFIS seizures
      in BFNIS generally occur in clusters over one or a few days with posterior focal
      seizure onset. BFNIS is caused by mutations in the <i>SCN2A</i> gene (2q24.3)
      encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-subunit Na(V)1.2. Transmission
      is autosomal dominant.
