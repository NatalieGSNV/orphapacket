    Contents: "A rare non-syndromic uterine malformation characterized by a uterus\
      \ with two uterine horns and only one cervix resulting from a failure in the\
      \ fusion of the two M\xFCllerian structures. Depending on the degree of the\
      \ fusion deficiency the malformation may be complete with the cavities separated\
      \ up to the internal orifice of the cervix and not linked or partial when there\
      \ is some linkage. Patients may present recurrent pregnancy loss or preterm\
      \ labor."
