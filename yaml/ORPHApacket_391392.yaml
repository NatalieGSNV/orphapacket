  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial episodic pain syndrome with predominantly lower limb involvement
      is a subtype of familial episodic pain syndrome characterized by intense episodic
      and/or cyclic pain mainly localized in the distal lower limbs (occasionally
      affecting upper limbs as well) which is triggered/exacerbated by fatigue cold
      exposure and/or weather changes and alleviated with anti-inflammatory medication
      that has a tendancy to diminish in frequency with age. Episodes usually occur
      late in the day last 15-30 min and associate sweating and a cold sensation of
      affected area.
