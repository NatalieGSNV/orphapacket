  TextSection:
    Contents: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a rare subtype of low-grade glioma of the central
      nervous system characterized by a well circumscribed often cystic brain tumor
      with a discrete mural nodule and long hair-like projections that extend from
      the neoplastic astrocytes. Depending on the primary localization and the size
      of the tumor patients can present with signs of raised intracranial pressure
      (headache vomiting papilledema) blurred vision decreased visual acuity ataxia
      and/or nystagmus among others. It is most commonly located in the cerebellum
      but ocurrence in the hypothalamus brain stem optic chiasma and hemispheres has
      also been reported.
