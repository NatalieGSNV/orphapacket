  TextSection:
    Contents: Sodium channelopathy-related small fiber neuropathy is a rare genetic
      peripheral neuropathy disorder due to gain-of-function mutations in voltage-gated
      sodium channels present in the small peripheral nerve fibers characterized by
      neuropathic pain of varying intensity (often beginning in the distal extermities
      and with a burning quality) associated with autonomic dysfunction (e.g. orthostatic
      dizziness palpitations dry eyes and mouth) abnormal quantitative sensory testing
      and reduction in intraepidermal nerve &#64257;ber density. Large fiber functions
      (i.e. normal strength tendon reflexes and vibration sense) and nerve conduction
      studies are typically normal.
