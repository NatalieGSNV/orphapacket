  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial median cleft of the upper and lower lips is a rare and isolated
      orofacial defect characterized by incomplete median clefts of both the lower
      lip (limited to the vermilion with no muscle involvement) and upper lip (with
      muscle involvement) double labial frenulum and fusion of the upper gingival
      and upper labial mucosa (resulting in a shallow upper vestibular fold) in addition
      to poor dental alignment and increased interdental distance between the lower
      and upper median incisors. Variable expressivity has been reported in an affected
      family.
