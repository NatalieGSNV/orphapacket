  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with recurrent genetic anomaly disorder
      characterized by an inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22) cytogenic abnormality
      which generates a CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene presenting with typical morphologic
      features of AML as well as abnormal bone marrow eosinophils (seen in all stages
      of maturation with no significant signs of maturation arrest). Myeloid sarcoma
      and involvement of the central nervous system is relatively common. Cytology
      reveals myeloblasts a significant monocytic component and variable numbers of
      immature eosinophils with atypical purple-violet granules in addition to eosinophilic
      granules. Presence of the fusion gene is sufficent for diagnosis irrespective
      of blast count.
