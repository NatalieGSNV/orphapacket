  TextSection:
    Contents: Perrault syndrome (PS) is characterized by the association of ovarian
      dysgenesis in females with sensorineural hearing impairment. In more recent
      PS reports some authors have described neurologic abnormalities notably progressive
      cerebellar ataxia and intellectual deficit.
