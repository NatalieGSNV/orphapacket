  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation characterized
      by iris coloboma cataract infantile spasms developmental delay and abnormal
      coagulation factors. The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in
      the gene <i>ALG2</i> (9q31.1). Transmission is autosomal recessive.
