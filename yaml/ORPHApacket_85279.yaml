  TextSection:
    Contents: Syndromic X-linked intellectual disability due to JARID1C mutation is
      characterised by mild to severe intellectual deficit associated with variable
      clinical manifestations including spasticity cryptorchidism maxillary hypoplasia
      alopecia areata epilepsy short stature impaired speech and behavioural problems.
      To date it has been described in less than 15 families. Transmission is X-linked
      recessive and the syndrome is caused by mutations in the <i>JARID1C</i> (<i>SMCX</i>)
      gene encoding a JmjC-domain protein with histone demethylase activity.
