    Contents: Choanal atresia - deafness - cardiac defects - dysmorphism syndrome
      also known as Burn-McKeown syndrome is an extremely rare multiple congenital
      anomaly syndrome characterized by bilateral choanal atresia (see this term)
      associated with a characteristic cranio-facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism with
      narrow palpebral fissures coloboma of inferior eyelid (see this term) with presence
      of eyelashes medial to the defect prominent nasal bridge thin lips prominent
      ears) that can be accompanied by hearing loss unilateral cleft lip preauricular
      tags cardiac septal defects and anomalies of the kidneys. The features of this
      syndrome overlaps considerably with those of the CHARGE syndrome (see this term).
