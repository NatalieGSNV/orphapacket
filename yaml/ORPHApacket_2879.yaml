  TextSection:
    Contents: Schinzel phocomelia syndrome also called limb/pelvis hypoplasia/aplasia
      syndrome is characterized by skeletal malformations affecting the ulnae pelvic
      bones fibulae and femora. As the phenotype is similar to that described in the
      malformation syndrome known as Al-Awadi/Raas-Rothschild syndrome they are thought
      to be the same disorder.
