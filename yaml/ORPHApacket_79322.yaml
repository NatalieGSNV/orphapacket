  TextSection:
    Contents: The CDG (Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation) syndromes are a group
      of autosomal recessive disorders affecting glycoprotein synthesis. CDG syndrome
      type Ie is characterised by psychomotor delay seizures hypotonia facial dysmorphism
      and microcephaly. Ocular anomalies are also very common.
