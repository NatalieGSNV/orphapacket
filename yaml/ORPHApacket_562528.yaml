  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome with intellectual
      disability characterized by severe congenital contractures of the limbs and
      face hypotonia neonatal respiratory distress and global developmental delay.
      Dysmorphic facial features include downslanting palpebral fissures broad nasal
      bridge large nares long philtrum and deep nasolabial folds among others. Limb
      deformities (camptodactyly clubfoot) short neck scoliosis as well as seizures
      have also been reported. Brain MRI may show cerebral and cerebellar atrophy
      in some cases.
