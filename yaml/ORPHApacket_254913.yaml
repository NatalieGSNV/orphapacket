    Contents: Isolated ATP synthase deficiency is a rare genetic mitochondrial oxidative
      phosphorylation disorder that may present with a wide range of symptoms (including
      muscular hypotonia hypertrophic cardiomyopathy psychomotor delay encephalopathy
      peripheral neuropathy lactic acidosis 3-methylglutaconic aciduria) and clinical
      syndromes (including NARP and MILS).
