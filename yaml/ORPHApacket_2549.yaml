  TextSection:
    Contents: Oculoauriculovertebral spectrum (OAVS) with radial defects is a rare
      branchial arches and limb primordia development disorder characterized by variable
      degrees of uni- or bilateral craniofacial malformation and radial defects that
      result in extremely variable phenotypic manifestations. Characteristic features
      include low postnatal weight short stature vertebral defects hearing loss and
      facial dysmorphism (incl. facial asymmetry external middle and inner ear malformations
      orofacial clefts and mandibular hypoplasia). These features are invariably associated
      with radial defects such as preaxial polydactyly thumb and/or radius hypoplasia/agenesis
      or triphalangeal thumb. Cardiac pulmonary renal and central nervous system involvement
      has also been reported.
