  TextSection:
    Contents: Bleeding diathesis due to a collagen receptor defect is a rare genetic
      coagulation disorder characterized by a mild to moderate bleeding tendency due
      to impaired platelet activation and aggregation in response to collagen or impaired
      platelet-vessel wall interaction resulting from a collagen receptor defect.
      Patients manifest with ecchymoses epistaxis menorrhagia and/or post-traumatic
      and post-surgery bleeding complications. Laboratory analysis reveals prolonged
      bleeding time and occasionally mild thrombocytopenia.
