  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A form of endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) that may result from excess
      secretion of cortisol by either a unilateral and benign (adrenocortical adenoma:
      55-60%) or malignant (adrenocortical carcinoma: 35-40 %) adrenocortical tumor
      or by bilateral adrenal secretion by macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH)
      as an isolated disease or as part of McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) or by primary
      pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) as an isolated disease or as
      part of Carney complex (CNC).'
