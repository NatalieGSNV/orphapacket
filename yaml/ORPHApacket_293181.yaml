    Contents: A rare genetic neonatal epilepsy syndrome disease characterized by onset
      in the first 6 months of life of almost continuous migrating polymorphous focal
      seizures with corresponding multifocal ictal electroencephalographic discharges
      progressive deterioration of psychomotor development and usually early mortality.
