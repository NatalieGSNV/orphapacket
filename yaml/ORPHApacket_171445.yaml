  TextSection:
    Contents: Muscle filaminopathy is a rare myofibrillar myopathy characterized by
      slowly progressive proximal skeletal muscle weakness which is initially more
      prominent in lower extremities and involves upper extremities with disease progression.
      Patients present with difficulty climbing stairs a waddling gait marked winging
      of scapula lower back pain paresis of limb girdle musculature hypo-/areflexia
      and/or mild facial muscle weakness in rare cases. Respiratory muscle weakness
      is common and cardiac anomalies (conduction blocks tachycardia diastolic dysfunction
      left ventricular hypertrophy) have been reported in some cases.
