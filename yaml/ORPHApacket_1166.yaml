  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital unilateral hypoplasia of depressor anguli oris is a congenital
      anomaly characterized by the unilateral hypoplasia/agenesis of the depressor
      anguli oris muscle resulting in an asymmetric crying facies in neonatal period/
      infancy (drooping of one corner of the mouth during crying) while eye closure
      nasolabial fold and forehead wrinkling are symmetric. While it can be isolated
      this anomaly is also seen in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (see this term) and can
      be accompanied by other major congenital anomalies of the cardiovascular system
      as well as less frequently the musculoskeletal cervicofacial respiratory genitourinary
      and rarely endocrine systems. When isolated the condition is cosmetically insignificant
      as the infant gets older (as the muscle does not contribute significantly to
      facial expression in childhood/ adulthood).
