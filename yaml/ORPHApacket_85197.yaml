  TextSection:
    Contents: Genochondromatosis is characterized by chondromatosis typically involving
      the clavicles upper end of the humerus and lower end of the femur. Lesions are
      bilateral and symmetrical. It has been described four patients from the same
      family and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. Another disorder genochondromatosis
      II shows strong similarities to genochondromatosis but is characterized by the
      involvement of the short tubular bones and by normal clavicles. It has been
      described in one unrelated family. Genochondromatosis II may also be inherited
      as an autosomal dominant trait. Genochondromatosis has a benign clinical course.
