    Contents: Chondrodysplasia - disorder of sex development is an extremely rare
      disorder of sex development (see this term) reported in only two siblings (one
      terminated in pregnancy) to date characterized by the clinical features of 46,XY
      complete gonadal dysgenesis (see this term; normal external female genitalia
      lack of pubertal development primary amenorrhea and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism)
      in association with severe dwarfism with generalized chondrodysplasia (bell-shaped
      thorax micromelia brachydactyly). Other reported features in the live sibling
      included eye anomalies (hypoplastic irides myopia coloboma of optic discs) dysmorphic
      features (deep-set eyes upslanting palpebral fissures puffy eyelids large ears
      and mouth mild prognathism) muscular hypoplasia mild intellectual deficiency
      and severe microcephaly with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. An autosomal recessive
      inheritance has been suggested.
