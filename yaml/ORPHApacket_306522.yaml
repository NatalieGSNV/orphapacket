    Contents: 'Familial primary hypomagnesemia with normocalcuria (FPHN) is a form
      of familial primary hypomagnesemia (FPH; see this term) which is characterized
      by low magnesium values but normal calcium values in the serum. The disorder
      consists of three distinct forms which are: autosomal recessive primary hypomagnesemia
      with normocalcuria and hypocalcemia (ARPHN) familial primary hypomagnesemia
      with normocalcuria and normocalcemia (FPHNN) and isolated autosomal dominant
      hypomagnesemia Glaudemans type (see these terms).'
