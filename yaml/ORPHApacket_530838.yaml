    Contents: A rare genetic isolated diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma characterized
      by diffuse mild to thick finely demarcated hyperkeratosis of palms and soles.
      Additional clinical findings include knuckle pad-like keratoses on fingers hyperkeratosis
      of umbilicus and areolae diffuse dry skin hyperhidrosis hangnails and frequent
      fungal infections. Histological examination of lesions reveals orthokeratotic
      hyperkeratosis acanthosis hypergranulosis and mild lymphocyte infiltrations
      in the upper dermis with no evidence of epidermolysis.
