      as a major feature characterized by QT prolongation congenital heart defects
      syndactyly facial dysmorphism and neurodevelopmental features. There are three
      clinical phenotypes recognized the classical types that present with a prolonged
      QT interval and either with (TS1) or without (TS2) cutaneous syndactyly of fingers
