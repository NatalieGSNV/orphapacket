  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant neurological disorder due to truncation mutations
      of the prion protein gene <i>PRNP</i> (20p13) leading to deposition of prion
      protein amyloid. Onset is usually in the fourth decade of life and reported
      clinical manifestations include diarrhea nausea autonomic failure (areflexia
