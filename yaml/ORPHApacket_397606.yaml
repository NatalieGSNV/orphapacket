  TextSection:
    Contents: Prion protein (PrP) systemic amyloidosis previously known as chronic
      diarrhea with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy is an extremely rare
      autosomal dominant disorder reported in three British families a Japanese and
      an Italian family (about 16 cases in total). Onset is usually in the fourth
      decade of life and the course lasts about 20 years. Reported clinical manifestations
      include diarrhea nausea autonomic failure (areflexia weakness) neurogenic bladder
      and urinary infections. The disorder is caused by truncation mutations of the
      prion protein gene <i>PRNP</i> (20p13) leading to deposition of prion protein
      amyloid.
