  TextSection:
    Contents: Neurofibromatosis (NF) type 3 (NF3) also known as schwannomatosis is
      the least frequent form of the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis. It is
      clinically and genetically distinct from NF1 and NF2 and is characterized by
      the development of multiple schwannomas (nerve sheath tumors) without involvement
      of the vestibular nerves. NF3 develops in adulthood and is often associated
      with chronic pain. Dysesthesia and paresthesia may also be present. Common localizations
      include the spine peripheral nerves and the cranium.
