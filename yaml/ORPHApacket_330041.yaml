  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hemoglobinopathy characterized by the presence of hemoglobin
      variants with structural abnormalities in the globin portion of the molecule
      which lead to auto-oxidation of heme iron resulting in methemoglobinemia. Patients
      present with cyanosis for which no treatment is necessary. Mode of inheritance
      is autosomal dominant.
