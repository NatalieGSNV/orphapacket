  TextSection:
    Contents: Tracheal agenesis (TA) is a rare congenital malformation in which the
      trachea may be completely absent (agenesis) or partially in place but underdeveloped
      (atresia). In both cases proximal-distal communication between the larynx and
      the alveoli of the lungs is lacking.
