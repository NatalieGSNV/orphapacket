  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital pseudoarthrosis of the limbs is a rare genetic non-syndromic
      limb malformation characterized by delayed union or non-union of a long bone
      resulting in formation of a false joint with abnormal mobility and angulation
      at the pseudoarthrosis site which manifests with progressive anterolateral forearm
      or leg bowing limb shortening and non-healing fractures. Typical histopathological
      findings include fibromatosis-like proliferation in the soft tissues with cystic
      or dysplastic lesions. Neurofibromatosis and osteofibrous dysplasia are frequently
      associated.
