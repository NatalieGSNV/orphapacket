    Contents: A rare ophthalmic disorder characterized by mostly unilateral failure
      of the regression of a fetal ocular vessel component the tunica vasculosa lentis
      and/or the hyaloid system resulting in an anterior (presenting with microphthalmia
      leukocoria cataract glaucoma elongated ciliary processes shallow anterior chamber
      and retrolental fibrovascular membranes among others) or posterior disease subtype
      (with microphthalmia leukocoria presence of a retinal fold or detachment hypo-
      or dysplastic optic nerve and vitreous membranes and stalk) respectively. Most
      patients present with a combination of the two subtypes.
