    Contents: Metaphyseal chondromatosis with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is an extremely
      rare genetic disorder characterized by the unique association of enchondromatosis
      with D-2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria (see these terms). Clinical features include
      enchondromatosis (with short stature severe metaphyseal dysplasia and mild vertebral
      involvement) elevated levels of urinary 2-hydroxyglutaric acid and mild developmental
      delay.
