    Contents: A rare non-paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis characterized by a severe
      but potentially treatable autoimmune encephalitis associated with autoantibodies
      against neurexin-3alpha. Patients present with prodromal fever headache or gastrointestinal
      symptoms followed by rapid progression to confusion seizures and decreased level
      of consciousness. Mild orofacial dyskinesia as well as life-threatening complications
      like central hypoventilation requiring respiratory support may develop in some
      patients.
