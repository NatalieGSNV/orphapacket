  TextSection:
    Contents: Blake pouch cyst is a non-syndromic usually benign cystic malformation
      of the posterior fossa characterized by a midline outpouching of the superior
      medullary velum into the cisterna magna that results from failure of the rudimental
      fourth ventricular tela choroidea to regress during embryogenesis. Patients
      can be asymptomatic or present in childhood or adulthood with clinical manifestations
      of hydrocephalus such as headache hypotonia vertigo syncope vomiting blurred
      or double vision nystagmus papilledema and delayed gait development.
