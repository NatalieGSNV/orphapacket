    Contents: Immunodeficiency due to MASP-2 deficiency is a rare genetic immunodeficiency
      due to a complement cascade protein anomaly characterized by low serum levels
      of MASP-2 and a variable susceptibility to bacterial infections (e.g. pulmonary
      tuberculosis pneumococcal pneumonia skin abscesses and sepsis) and autoimmune
      diseases (e.g. inflammatory lung disease cystic fibrosis systemic lupus erythematosus).
      In many cases it remains asymptomatic.
