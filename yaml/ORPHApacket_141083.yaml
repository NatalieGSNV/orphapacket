    Contents: Nasolacrimal duct cyst describes a unilateral or bilateral congenital
      cyst of the nasolacrimal duct which is almost always associated with dacryocystocele
      presenting most commonly at birth or a few weeks of age (but rarely presenting
      in adulthood) as a benign grayish blue mass in the inferomedial canthus or in
      the nasal cavity that can cause epiphora dacryocystitis (inflammation of the
      lacrimal sac) and nasal obstruction. It is more commonly reported in females.
