    Contents: A rare hematologic disease characterized by clinical and morphological
      findings indistinguishable from those of acute myeloid leukemia typically occurring
      in newborns with Down syndrome. Peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts display
      features suggestive of megakaryoblasts. In addition to trisomy 21 acquired GATA1
      mutations are present in blast cells. Patients may be asymptomatic or present
      with thrombocytopenia less commonly other cytopenias leukocytosis hepatosplenomegaly
      jaundice ascites respiratory distress bleeding and pericardial or pleural effusions.
      Most patients undergo spontaneous remission within the first three months of
      life although some may develop life-threatening hepatic renal or cardiac complications.
