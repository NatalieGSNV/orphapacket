  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities
      characterized by leukocytosis thrombocytosis and nonspecific symptoms related
      to ineffective hematopoiesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising recurrent infections
      bone pain) with frequent extramedullary involvement typically presenting as
      gingival hyperplasia and lymphadenopathy. The disease is characterized by clonal
      proliferation of myeloid blasts harboring mutations of the <i>NPM1</i> gene
      in the bone marrow blood and other tissues. It is associated with multilineage
      dysplasia involving the myeloid monocytic erythroid and megakaryocytic cell
      lineages.
