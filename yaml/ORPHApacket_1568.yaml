      ganglia disease and seizures (XDIBS) or Pettigrew syndrome is a central nervous
      system malformation characterized by severe intellectual deficit early hypotonia
      with progression to spasticity and contractures choreoathetosis seizures dysmorphic
      face (long face with prominent forehead) and brain imaging abnormalities such
      as Dandy-Walker malformation (see this term) and iron deposition.
