  TextSection:
    Contents: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is characterized
      by the persistence of thromboemboli in the form of organized tissue obstructing
      the pulmonary arteries. The consequence is an increase in pulmonary vascular
      resistance (PVR) resulting in pulmonary hypertension (PH) and progressive right
      heart failure.
