  TextSection:
    Contents: Spondylo-megaepiphyseal-metaphyseal dysplasia is a rare genetic primary
      bone displasia characterized by disproportionate short stature with short stiff
      neck and trunk and relatively long limbs fingers and toes (which may present
      flexion contractures) severe vertebral body ossification delay (with frequent
      kyknodysostosis) markedly enlarged round epiphyses of the long bones absent
      ossification of pubic bones and multiple pseudoepiphyses of the short tubular
      bones in hands and feet. Neurological manifestations resulting from cervical
      spine instability may be observed.
