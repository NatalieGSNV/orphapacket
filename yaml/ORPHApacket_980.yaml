    Contents: Unilateral absence of the pulmonary artery (UAPA) is a rare congenital
      great vessels anomaly that commonly presents by dyspnea frequent respiratory
      infections hemoptysis and high-altitude pulmonary edema. UAPA is often associated
      with congenital heart malformation (CHM see this term). In the absence of associated
      cardiac malformation (isolated UAPA; IUAPA) the condition may be asymptomatic
      until adult age.
