  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare group of mastocytosis diseases characterized by abnormal accumulation
      and proliferation of mast cells in the skin and including the three recognised
      forms: diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis cutaneous mastocytoma and the most common
      form maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis. In some cases (most commonly in adults)
      cutaneous mastocytosis may occur in association with mast cell infiltration
      of various extracutaneous organs in which case the disorder is referred to as
      systemic mastocytosis.'
