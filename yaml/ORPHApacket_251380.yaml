    Contents: A rare genetic hemoglobinopathy characterized by generally mild clinical
      phenotype high fetal hemoglobin levels and mild microcytosis and hypochromia.
      In some cases acute sickle cell disease manifestations were reported namely
      acute chest syndrome and acute pain crisis.
