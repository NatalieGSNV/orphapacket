  TextSection:
    Contents: Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome (HIHA) is a frequent form of
      diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism (see this term) characterized by
      an excessive/ uncontrolled insulin secretion (inappropriate for the level of
      glycemia) asymptomatic hyperammonemia and recurrent episodes of profound hypoglycemia
      induced by fasting and protein rich meals requiring rapid and intensive treatment
      to prevent neurological sequelae. Epilepsy and cognitive deficit that are unrelated
      to hypoglycemia may also occur.
