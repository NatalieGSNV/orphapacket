    Contents: 2q33.1 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from the partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 2 with a highly
      variable phenotype typically characterized by severe intellectual disability
      moderate to severe developmental delay (particularly speech) feeding difficulties
      failure to thrive hypotonia thin sparse hair various dental abnormalities and
      cleft/high-arched palate. Typical dysmorphic features inlcude high prominent
