  TextSection:
    Contents: Cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response (CDSRR) is an inherited
      retinopathy with an onset in the first or second decade of life characterized
      by poor visual acuity (due to central scotoma) photophobia severe dyschromatopsia
      and occasionally nystagmus. Night blindness usually develops later in the course
      of the disease but it can also be apparent from childhood. A hallmark of CDSRR
      is the decreased and delayed dark-adapted response to dim flashes in electroretinographic
      recordings which contrasts with the supernormal b-wave response at the highest
      levels of stimulation.
