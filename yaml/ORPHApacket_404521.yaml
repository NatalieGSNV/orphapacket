  TextSection:
    Contents: Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 2 is a rare genetic
      motor neuron disease characterized by progressive early respiratory failure
      associated with diaphragm paralysis distal muscular weakness joint contractures
      and axial hypotonia with preserved antigravity limb movements. Phenotype overlaps
      considerably with SMARD type 1 but is differentiated by a mutation in a different
      gene.
