      chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus
      symptoms in two or more members of a single family. Patients present a wide
      spectrum of clinical manifestations including cutaneous (malar rash photosensitivity)
      ocular (keratoconjunctivitis sicca retinopathy) gastrointestinal (oral ulceration
      abdominal pain) cardiac (atherosclerosis chest pain) pulmonary (serositis pleurisy)
      musculoskeletal (arthralgia myalgia) renal (nephritis hematuria) obstetrical
      (increased spontaneous abortions neonatal lupus) constitutional (fatigue loss
      of appetite) and neuropsychiatric (mood and cognitive disorders) involvement
