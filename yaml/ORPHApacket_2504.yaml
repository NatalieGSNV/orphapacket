    Contents: Metaphyseal dysplasia-maxillary hypoplasia-brachydacty syndrome is characterized
      by metaphyseal dysplasia associated with short stature and facial dysmorphism
      (a beaked nose short philtrum thin lips maxillary hypoplasia dystrophic yellowish
      teeth) and acral anomalies (short fifth metacarpals and/or short middle phalanges
      of fingers two and five). It has been described in several members spanning
      four generations of a French-Canadian family. The syndrome is likely to be transmitted
      as an autosomal dominant trait.
