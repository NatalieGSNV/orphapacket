    Contents: Familial Scheuermann disease is characterized by kyphotic deformity
      of the spine that develops in adolescence. The spinal deformity includes irregularities
      of the vertebral endplates the presence of Schmorl's nodes disk-space narrowing
      and vertebral wedging and is diagnosed using lateral radiographs of the spine.
      The thoracic spine is most often affected but the lumbar spine may also be involved.
      Analysis of the mode of inheritance in a sample of 90 pedigrees derived from
      the Siberian population supported an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance
      with complete penetrance in boys and incomplete penetrance in girls.
