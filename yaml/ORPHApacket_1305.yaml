    Contents: 'Feingold syndrome (FS) also known as oculo-digito-esophageal-duodenal
      (ODED) syndrome is a rare inherited malformation syndrome characterized by microcephaly
      short stature and numerous digital anomalies and is comprised of two subtypes:
      FS type 1 (FS1) and FS type 2 (FS2) (see these terms). FS1 is by far the most
      common form while FS2 has only been reported in 3 patients and has the same
      clinical characteristics as FS1 apart from the absence of gastrointestinal atresia
      and short palpebral fissures.'
