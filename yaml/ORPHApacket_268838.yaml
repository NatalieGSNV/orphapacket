  TextSection:
    Contents: Leptomyelolipoma is a rare neural tube closure defect characterized
      by an abnormally low lying conus which is tethered by a lumbosacral lipomatous
      mass (containing fatty tissue nerve fibers meningeal strands and fibrous bands)
      which engulfs the filum terminale and varying numbers of dorsal and ventral
      nerve root components typically producing sensory motor bowel and/or bladder
      dysfunction. Cutaneous stigmata absent or reduced reflexes and foot defomities
      (e.g. talipes cavovalgus) are frequently present.
