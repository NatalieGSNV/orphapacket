    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: A rare familial cardiomyopathy characterized by the dilation of left
      ventricle and progressively impairing of systolic ventricular function in the
      absence of abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease sufficient
      to cause global systolic impairment. The disease may cause heart failure or
      arrhythmia. The disease is isolated when no additional atypical cardiac or extracardiac
      manifestations are present.
