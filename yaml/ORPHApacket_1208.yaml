  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare form of cyanotic congenital heart malformation characterized
      by severe cyanosis and tachypnea. It presents significant morphologic diversity:
      at the end of the spectrum are patients with a mildly hypoplastic and tripartite
      right ventricle (RV) and mild tricuspid valve (TV) hypoplasia and at the other
      end are patients with severe RV and TV hypoplasia often with RV-dependent coronary
      circulation.'
