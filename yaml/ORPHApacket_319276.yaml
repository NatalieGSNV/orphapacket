    Contents: A rare renal tumor arising from proximal tubular epithelial cells of
      the renal cortex characterized histologically by malignant epithelial cells
      with typical clear cytoplasm in conventional staining methods due to a high
      glycogen and lipid content featuring a nested growth pattern. Clinically it
      may present with hematuria flank pain anemia or less commonly a palpable abdominal
      mass.
