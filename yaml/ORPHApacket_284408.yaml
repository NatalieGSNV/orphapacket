    Contents: Infantile glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is a severe form of GKD (see
      this term) characterized clinically by poor feeding failure to thrive salt-wasting
      dehydration vomiting Addisonian pigmentation hypotonia and disorders of consciousness.
      Some patients have complex GKD associated with adrenal hypoplasia congenita
      and/or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (see these terms) with manifestations
      including intellectual deficit dysmorphic facial features abnormal external
