  TextSection:
    Contents: Kallmann syndrome (KS) is a developmental genetic disorder characterized
      by the association of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) due to
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency and anosmia or hyposmia (with
      hypoplasia or aplasia of the olfactory bulbs).
