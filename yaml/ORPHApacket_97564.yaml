  TextSection:
    Contents: Pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (GN) without antineutrophilic cytoplasmic
      antibodies (ANCA) is a form of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis comprising
      10-43% of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (see this term) and characterized
      by the absence of ANCA. In comparison with pauci-immune GN with ANCA (see this
      term) patients lacking ANCA may be younger at onset of the disease and have
      a shorter interval from onset of the disease to diagnosis. They have fewer extra
      renal manifestations (e.g. involvement of lung eye ear nose and throat) fewer
      constitutional symptoms (e.g. fever weight loss muscle pain and arthralgia)
      and a high prevalence of nephrotic syndrome and chronic renal lesions. Their
      prognosis is generally poorer.
