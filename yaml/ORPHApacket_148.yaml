  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of inborn errors of biotin metabolism characterized by reduced
      activities of biotin-dependent enzymes resulting in a wide spectrum of symptoms
      including feeding difficulty breathing difficulties lethargy seizures skin rash
      alopecia and developmental delay. This group includes biotinidase deficiency
      and biotin holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency.
