  TextSection:
    Contents: Juvenile temporal arteritis (JTA) is an extremely uncommon vasculitis
      of unknown etiology. Eleven documented cases have been reported in the literature
      affecting older children and young adults. In contrast to the classic form of
      temporal arteritis it is not a systemic disease nor does it cause local symptoms
      at the temporal area. The term JTA was coined by Lie and his colleagues in 1975
      when they reported four cases of an otherwise asymptomatic disease presenting
      with a painless nodule at the temporal region. None of the cases showed evidence
      of systemic disease or history of trauma to the temporal region. Excisional
      biopsy of the lesions revealed a non-giant cell granulomatous inflammation of
      the temporal arteries with eosinophilic infiltration intimal proliferation and
      microaneurysmal disruption of the media. JTA has a benign clinical course is
      treated by surgical excision and does not recur.
