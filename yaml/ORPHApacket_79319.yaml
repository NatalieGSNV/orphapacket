    Contents: MPI-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
      characterized by cyclic vomiting profound hypoglycemia failure to thrive liver
      fibrosis gastrointestinal complications (protein-losing enteropathy with hypoalbuminaemia
      life-threatening intestinal bleeding of diffuse origin) and thrombotic events
      (protein C and S deficiency low anti-thrombine III levels) whereas neurological
      development and cognitive capacity is usually normal. The clinical course is
      variable even within families. The disease is caused by loss of function of
      the gene <i>MPI</i> (15q24.1).
