  TextSection:
    Contents: Immunodeficiency due to CD25 deficiency is a rare genetic primary immunodeficiency
      due to a defect in adaptive immunity disorder characterized by severe immunodeficiency
      presenting with profound susceptibility to viral fungal and bacterial infections
      due to impaired CD25-mediated T-regulatory cell function in association with
      severe autoimmune disease such as alopecia universalis erythrodermia and autoimmune
      thyroiditis and enteropathy.
