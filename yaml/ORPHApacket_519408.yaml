  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of the anterior segment of the eye characterized by
      a unilateral or bilateral rapidly progressive intractable painful ulcerative
      keratitis which initially affects the peripheral cornea and may spread circumferentially
      and then centrally. The destructive process involves stromal corneal tissue
      only leaving the epithelium and endothelium largely unaffected. There is no
      involvement of the adjacent sclera. The condition can be complicated by glaucoma
      cataract and perforation.
