  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by increased susceptibility
      to infection by human papillomavirus presenting in childhood with disseminated
      flat wart-like cutaneous lesions. Burkitt lymphoma has also been reported. Whilst
      total T-cell counts are normal there is impaired TCR signaling profound peripheral
      naive T-cell lymphopenia with memory T-cells displaying an exhaustion phenotype.
