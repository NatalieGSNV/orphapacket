  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ciliopathy characterized by the association of nephronophthisis
      and liver fibrosis. Renal manifestations include chronic renal failure polyuria
      polydipsia anemia as well as increased echogenicity on renal ultrasound and
      interstitial fibrosis and tubular dilation on biopsy. Hepatic involvement manifests
      as hepatosplenomegaly with extensive fibrosis destruction of the bile ducts
      and cholestasis. Mild psychomotor retardation and ocular symptoms such as strabismus
      nystagmus retinal degeneration and anisocoria have been reported in some patients.
