  TextSection:
    Contents: King-Denborough syndrome is a rare genetic non-dystrophic myopathy characterized
      by the triad of congenital myopathy dysmorphic features and susceptibility to
      malignant hyperthermia. Patients present with a wide phenotypic range including
      delayed motor development muscle weakness and fatigability ptosis and facies
      myopathica (with or without creatine kinase elevations) skeletal abnormalities
      (e.g. short stature scoliosis kyphosis lumbar lordosis and pectus carinatum/excavatum)
      mild dysmorphic facial features (e.g. hypertelorism down-slanting palpebral
      fissures epicanthic folds low set ears micrognathia) webbing of the neck cryptorchidism
      and a susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia and/or rhabdomyolysis due to
      intensive physical strain viral infection or statin use.
