  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities
      characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid blasts harboring somatic mutations
      of the <i>CEBPA</i> gene in the bone marrow blood and rarely other tissues.
      It can present with anemia thrombocytopenia and other nonspecific symptoms related
      to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising recurrent infections
      bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement (gingivitis splenomegaly).
