    Contents: A rare inherited cancer-predisposing syndrome characterized by predisposition
      to a wide variety of cancers including neoplasms of the digestive tract urinary
      tract kidney endometrium ovary brain and prostate as well as sebaceous skin
      tumors depending on the gene involved. Tumors may occur at any age but often
      arise in young people. Factors influencing individual tumor risk include sex
      age affected gene and personal history of cancer.
