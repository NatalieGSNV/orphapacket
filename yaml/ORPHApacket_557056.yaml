  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurometabolic disease characterized by childhood onset
      of global developmental delay progressive spastic ataxia leading to loss of
      independent ambulation and elevated plasma levels of glutamine. Optic atrophy
      tremor and dysarthria have also been reported. Brain imaging may show cerebellar
      atrophy.
