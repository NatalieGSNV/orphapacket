    Contents: Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder
      characterized by persistent CD4 T-cell lymphopenia (less than 300 cells/ÂµL on
      multiple occasions) not associated with any other underlying primary or secondary
      immune deficiency. Patients typically present opportunistic infections (with
      cryptococcal mycobacterial candidal varicella zoster virus infections and progressive
      multifocal leukoencephalopathy being the most prevalent) malignancies (mainly
      lymphoproliferative disorders) or autoimmune disorders. Some individuals are
      asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed.
