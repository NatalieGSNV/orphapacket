      by early onset muscular dystrophy severe muscular hypotonia severe mental retardation
      and typical brain and eye malformations including pachygyria polymicrogyria
      agyria brainstem and cerebellar structural anomalies severe myopia glaucoma
      optic nerve and retinal hypoplasia. Patients may present with seizures macrocephaly
