  TextSection:
    Contents: Young adult-onset distal hereditary motor neuropathy is a rare autosomal
      recessive distal hereditary motor neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive
      muscular weakness hypotonia and atrophy of the lower limbs more pronounced distally
      leading to paralysis and loss of tendon reflexes. Additional features may include
      pes cavus and mild dysphonia. The upper limbs are relatively spared.
