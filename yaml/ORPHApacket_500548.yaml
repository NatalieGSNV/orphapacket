    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by osteosclerosis localized
      predominantly to the metaphyses and epiphyseal margins of the appendicular bones
      and metaphyseal equivalents of the axial bones as well as the vertebral endplates
      costal ends and margins of the flat bones. The skull is usually unaffected.
      The condition is associated with developmental delay and hypotonia. Seizures
      and spastic paraplegia have also been reported. Serum alkaline phosphatase and
      urinary pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline levels may be elevated.
