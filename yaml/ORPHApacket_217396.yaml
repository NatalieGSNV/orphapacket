    Contents: Progressive polyneuropathy with bilateral striatal necrosis is a rare
      genetic disorder of thiamine metabolism and transport characterized by the childhood-onset
      of recurrent episodes of flaccid paralysis and encephalopathy associated with
      bilateral striatal necrosis and chronic progressive axonal polyneuropathy with
      proximal and distal muscle weakness areflexia contractures and foot deformities.
