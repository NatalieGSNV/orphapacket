    Contents: Late-onset retinal degeneration is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized
      by delayed dark adaptation and nyctalopia and drusen deposits presenting in
      adulthood followed by cone and rod degeneration that presents in the sixth decade
      of life which leads to central vision loss. Anterior segment features such as
      peripupillary iris transillumination defects and abnormally long anterior zonular
      insertions are also observed. Choroidal neovascularization and glaucoma may
      occur in the late stages of the disease.
