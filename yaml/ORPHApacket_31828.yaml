  TextSection:
    Contents: Digitalis (digoxin) poisoning is a potentially life-threatening poisoning
      that provokes conduction disturbances characterized by increased automaticity
      and decreased conduction. Acute poisoning presents with the common initial manifestations
      of nausea and vomiting cardiovascular manifestations (bradycardia heart block
      and a variety of dysrhythmias) central nervous system manifestations (lethargy
      confusion and weakness) and hyperkalemia. Chronic poisoning is more insidious
      manifesting with gastrointestinal symptoms altered mental status and visual
      disturbances.
