  TextSection:
    Contents: Intraneural perineurioma is a rare tumor of cranial and spinal nerves
      arising from peripheral nerve sheath and composed exclusively or predominantly
      of cells showing perineurial differentiation. It presents as a localized tubular
      or fusiform enlargement of a nerve or nerve segment usually in the extremities
      or the trunk associated with a motor-predominant mononeuropathy including slow
      painless gradual loss of motor function in the involved nerve trunk with muscle
      weakness and atrophy and rarely sensory dysfunction. Cranial nerve involvement
      is rare.
