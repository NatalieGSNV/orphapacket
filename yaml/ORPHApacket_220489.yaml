  TextSection:
    Contents: Rare hereditary hemochromatosis comprises the rare forms of hereditary
      hemochromatosis (HH) a group of diseases characterized by excessive tissue iron
      deposition. These rare forms are hemochromatosis type 2 (juvenile) type 3 (TFR2-related)
      and type 4 (ferroportin disease) (see these terms). Hemochromatosis type 1 (also
      called classic hemochromatosis; see this term) is not a rare disease.
