    Contents: Hereditary glaucoma is a clinically diverse group of rare eye disorders
      with genetic predisposition characterized by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)
      and glaucomatous changes of the optic nerve head leading to field defects visual
      loss and blindness. Hereditary glaucoma can be sub-classified as primary (congenital
      glaucoma juvenile glaucoma) or secondary according to the presence or absence
      of systemic or other ocular anomalies (iridogoniodysgenesis Stickler syndrome
      Coats syndrome). The clinical presentation is variable and is based on age severity
      of glaucoma presence of ocular abnormalities and development of secondary IOP
      related abnormalities.
