    Contents: Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection is a rare genetic
      vascular disease characterized by the familial occurrence of thoracic aortic
      aneurysm dissection or dilatation affecting one or more aortic segments (aortic
      root ascending aorta arch or descending aorta) in the absence of any other associated
      disease. Depending on the size location and progression rate of dilatation/dissection
      patients may be asymptomatic or may present dyspnea cough jaw neck chest or
      back pain head neck or upper limb edema difficulty swallowing voice hoarseness
      pale skin faint pulse and/or numbness/tingling in limbs. Patients have increased
      risk of presenting life threatening aortic rupture.
