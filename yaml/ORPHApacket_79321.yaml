    Contents: A form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation characterized
      by severe neurological involvement including hypotonia developmental delay intellectual
      disability postnatal microcephaly and progressive brain and cerebellar atrophy.
      Epilepsy with hypsarrythmia is frequently reported. Additional features that
      may be observed include failure to thrive arthrogryposis multiplex congenita
      (AMC) vision impairment (optic atrophy iris coloboma) and facial dysmorphism
      (hypertelorism with a broad nasal bridge large and thick ears thin lips micrognathia).
      The disease is caused by loss of function mutations of the gene <i>ALG3</i>
      (3q27.3).
