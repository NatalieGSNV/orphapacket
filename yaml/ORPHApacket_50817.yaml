  TextSection:
    Contents: Duane anomaly-myopathy-scoliosis syndrome is characterised by the association
      of bilateral Duane anomaly type 3 severe scoliosis of early onset congenital
      myopathy with hypotonia without muscular weakness delayed motor development
      and short stature. It has been described in one pair of sibs. The Duane type
      3 anomaly consists of eye abduction and adduction palsy globe retraction and
      narrowing of the palpebral fissure. Muscular biopsy shows aspecific myopathy.
      Intellectual development is normal. The syndrome is most likely inherited in
      an autosomal recessive manner. It differs from the Crisfield-Dretakis-Sharpe
      syndrome in which short stature and muscular features are absent. Surgery of
      the scoliosis is necessary. Functional prognosis depends on the severity of
      the visual handicap.
