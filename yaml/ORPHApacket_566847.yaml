  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare central nervous system malformations characterized by
      varying degrees of absence or dysplasia of the derivatives of the prosencephalon
      (i. e. telencephalon and diencephalon) with an intact cranial vault. The spectrum
      comprises atelencephaly the less severe form in which only the telencephalon
      is affected and aprosencephaly where the diencephalon is also involved. The
      malformations may occur in an isolated form or in association with other anomalies.
