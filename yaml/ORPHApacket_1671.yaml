      of the spinal cord with an interposed osseous cartilaginous or fibrous septum
      and double dural sac typically occurring at the thoracic or lumbar level. Local
      vertebral segmental defects syringomyelia meningocele and intraspinal tumors
      may be associated. Variable clinical presentation includes pain scoliosis asymmetry
      and weakness of the lower limbs neurological deficits sphincter dysfunction
      and various cutaneous abnormalities overlying the spine such as hypertrichosis
      dimple hemangioma subcutaneous mass or pigmented nevus.
