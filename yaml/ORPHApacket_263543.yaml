  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Generalized peeling skin syndrome (PSS) is a form of PSS (see this
      term) presenting with a generalized distribution. It comprises two sub-types:
      the non-inflammatory (PSS type A) and the inflammatory (PSS type B) form (see
      these terms). PSS type A is characterized by generalized white scaling with
      superficial peeling of the skin while PSS type B is characterized by superficial
      patchy peeling of the entire skin with underlying erythroderma associated with
      pruritus and atopy.'
