  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Lenz microphthalmia syndrome is a very rare X-linked inherited form
      of syndromic microphthalmia (see this term) characterized by unilateral or bilateral
      microphthalmia (and/or clinical anophthalmia) with or without coloboma in addition
      to a range of extraocular manifestations such as microcephaly malformed ears
      dental abnormalities (i.e. irregular shape of incisors) skeletal anomalies (duplicated
      thumbs syndactyly clinodactyly camptodactyly (see these terms)) urogenital anomalies
      (hypospadias cryptorchidism renal dysgenesis hydroureter) and mild to severe
      intellectual disability. It is allelic to two disorders: oculofaciocardiodental
      syndrome and premature aging appearance-developmental delay-cardiac arrhythmia
      syndrome (see these terms).'
