  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a lobulated localized (lipoblastoma)
      or diffuse (lipoblastomatosis) lesion resembling fetal adipose tissue composed
      of mature and immature adipocytes. It is most commonly found during the first
      years of life and presents as a slowly growing well circumscribed mass which
      may compress adjacent structures depending on the location. Malignant transformation
      or metastasis does not occur while recurrences are described especially in lipoblastomatosis.
