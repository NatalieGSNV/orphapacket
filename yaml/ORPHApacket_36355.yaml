  TextSection:
    Contents: P2Y12 defect is a rare hemorrhagic disorder characterized by mild to
      moderate bleeding diathesis with easy bruising mucosal bleedings and excessive
      post-operative hemorrhage due to defect of the platelet P2Y12 receptor resulting
      in selective impairment of platelet responses to adenosine diphosphate.
