  TextSection:
    Contents: Medulloepithelioma of the central nervous system is a rare primitive
      neuroectodermal tumor characterized by papillary tubular and trabecular arrangements
      of neoplastic neuroepithelium mimicking the embryonic neural tube most commonly
      found in the periventricular region within the cerebral hemispheres but has
      also been reported in brainstem and cerebellum. It usually presents in childhood
      with headache nausea vomiting facial nerve paresis and/or cerebellar ataxia
      and typically has a progressive course highly malignant behavior and poor prognosis.
      Hearing and visual loss have also been observed.
