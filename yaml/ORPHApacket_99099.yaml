      an upper and lower chamber. The upper chamber receives blood from the pulmonary
      veins the lower chamber is attached to the left atrial appendage blocking the
      mitral valve orifice and leading to obstruction of the left ventricular inflow.

      chest pain syncope pulmonary edema pulmonary hypertension or heart failure depending
      on the degree of obstruction. The anomaly may be isolated or associated with
