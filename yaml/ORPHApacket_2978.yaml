  TextSection:
    Contents: Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a rare gastrointestinal
      motility disorder characterized by recurring episodes resembling mechanical
      obstruction in the absence of organic systemic or metabolic disorders and without
      any physical obstruction being detected by X-ray or during surgery. CIPO develops
      predominantly in children and may be present at birth.
