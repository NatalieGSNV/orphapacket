    Contents: Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disorder of impaired net acid
      secretion by the distal tubule characterized by hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
      The classic form is often associated with hypokalemia whereas other forms of
      acquired dRTA may be associated with hypokalemia hyperkalemia or normokalemia.
