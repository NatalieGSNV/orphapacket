    Contents: GM3 synthase deficiency is a rare congenital disorder of glycosylation
      due to impaired synthesis of complex ganglioside species initially characterized
      by irritability poor feeding failure to thrive and early-onset refractory epilepsy
      followed by postnatal growth impairment severe developmental delay or developmental
      regression profound intellectual disability deafness and abnormalities of skin
      pigmentation (mostly freckle-like hyperpigmented and depigmented macules). Visual
      impairment due to cortical atrophy (visible on magnetic resonance imaging) choreoathetosis
      and hypotonic tetraparesis usually appear gradually. Dysmorphic facial features
      may be associated.
