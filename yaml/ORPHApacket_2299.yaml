  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare heart defect characterized by complete lack of anatomical continuity
      between the transverse aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta. AAI should
      be distinguished anatomically from atresia of the aortic arch where continuity
      between these segments is achieved by an imperforate fibrous strand of various
      lengths.
