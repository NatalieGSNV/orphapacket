    Contents: A rare genetic spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia disease characterized
      by short-limbed short stature (more pronounced in lower limbs) associated with
      characterisitic facial dysmorphism (i.e. relative macrocephaly frontal bossing
      midface hypoplasia depressed nasal root small upturned nose prognathism) and
      abnormal radiological findings which include abnormal vertebral bodies (particularly
      in the lumbar region) striated metaphyses generalized mild osteoporosis and
      delayed ossification of the carpal bones. Progressive coxa vara short dental
      roots hypogammaglobulinemia and cataracts may be occasionally associated.
