    Contents: Male infertility due to large-headed multiflagellar polypoid spermatozoa
      is a male infertility due to sperm disorder characterized by the presence in
      sperm of a very high percentage of spermatozoa with enlarged head irregular
      head shape multiple flagella and abnormal midpiece and acrosome. It is generally
      associated with severe oligoasthenozoospermia and a high rate of sperm chromosomal
      abnormalities (polyploidy aneuploidy).
