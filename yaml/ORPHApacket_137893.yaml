    Contents: A rare male infertility due to a sperm disorder characterized by the
      presence in sperm of a very high percentage of spermatozoa with enlarged head
      irregular head shape multiple flagella and abnormal midpiece and acrosome. It
      is generally associated with severe oligoasthenozoospermia and a high rate of
      sperm chromosomal abnormalities (polyploidy aneuploidy).
