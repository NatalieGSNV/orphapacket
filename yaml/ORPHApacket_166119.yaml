    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by multiple small round
      to ovoid osteosclerotic foci with a predilection for the epiphyses and metaphyses
      of long tubular bones as well as the pelvis scapula carpal and tarsal bones.
      The condition is usually clinically silent and discovered only incidentally
      although some patients may experience mild articular pain with or without joint
      effusion. Bone strength is normal.
