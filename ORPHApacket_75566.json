It manifests with symptoms like edema, fatigue and shortness of breath. It is usually secondary to eosinophil-associated tissue damage and is associated with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, chronic eosinophilic leukemia (see these terms), carcinoma, or lymphoma."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"3","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Eosinophilic endocarditis"}]}]}]}
