- TextSection:
  - Contents: Loiasis is a form of filariasis (see this term), caused by the parasitic
      worm <i>Loa loa</i>, endemic to the forest and savannah regions of Central and
      Western Africa. Loiasis may either be asymptomatic or manifest as a large, transient
      area of localized, non-erythematous subcutaneous edema (Calabar swellings),
      adult worm migration through the sub-conjunctiva (''African eye worm'') and
      pruritus. Generalized itching, hives, muscle pains, arthralgias, fatigue, and
      adult worms visibly migrating under the surface of the skin may be observed.
      Severe complications such as encephalopathy have been reported in highly infected
      individuals receiving ivermectin during mass drug administration programs for
      the control of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (see these terms).
