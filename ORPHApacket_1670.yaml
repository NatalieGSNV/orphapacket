- TextSection:
  - Contents: Chronic diarrhea with villous atrophy is a rare, genetic gastroenterological
      disease characterized by the early onset of chronic diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia,
      lactic acidosis, renal insufficiency and hepatic involvement (mild elevation
      of liver enzymes, steatosis, hepatomegaly). Partial villous atrophy (with eosinophilic
      infiltration) is observed on intestinal biopsy. Although diarrhea may resolve,
      the development of neurologic symptoms (cerebellar ataxia, sensorineural deafness,
      seizures), retinitis pigmentosa and muscle weakness may complicate disease course
      and lead to death. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1994.
