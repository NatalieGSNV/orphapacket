- TextSection:
  - Contents: Subependymoma is a rare and slow growing type of ependymoma (see this
      term), often presenting in middle-aged adults, found more commonly in men than
      in women, usually located in the fourth and lateral ventricles and manifesting
      with variable symptoms including headache, nausea, and loss of balance. In some
      cases it can be asymptomatic. It is usually associated with a better prognosis
      than other forms of ependymoma.
