- TextSection:
  - Contents: Rare endometriosis is a rare, non-malformative gynecologic disease characterized
      by the presence of functional endometrial glands and stroma in extrapelvic locations,
      such as lungs, pleura, kidneys, bladder, abdominal wall, umbilicus, and cesarean
      section scar among others. Clinical manifestations are menstrually-related and
      depend on the location of the ectopic tissue, but in general include pain, mass/nodule,
      swelling and/or bleeding in the involved area.
