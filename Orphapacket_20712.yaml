- TextSection:
  - Contents: Infective dermatitis associated with HTLV-1 is a rare and severe chronic
      disease characterized by recurrent chronic eczema (with erythematous, scaly
      and crusted lesions) mainly affecting seborrheic areas (e.g. scalp, forehead,
      eyelids, paranasal and periauricular skin, neck, axillae, and groin), a generalized
      fine papular rash, chronic nasal discharge with crusting of the anterior nares,
      and non-virulent <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> or beta-hemolytic <i>Streptococcus</i>
      infections, thought to be a result of HTLV-1-induced immunosuppression. Lymphadenopathy,
      anemia, mild to moderate pruritus and increased incidence of other infections
      (e.g. crusted scabies) have also been reported in some patients. Patients may
      subsequently develop other HTLV-1 associated conditions such as adult T-cell
      leukemia/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis (see these terms).
