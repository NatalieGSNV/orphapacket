Patients often present with dysfunctional uterine bleeding, pelvic or abdominal mass and, especially in later stages of the disease, abdominal pain. Symptomatic metastatic spread or symptoms related to a paraneoplastic syndrome, such as retinopathy, or Cushing syndrome due to ectopic ACTH production, may be associated."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"High-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine corpus"},{"lang":"en","label":"Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the corpus uteri"},{"lang":"en","label":"Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the endometrium"}]}]}]}
