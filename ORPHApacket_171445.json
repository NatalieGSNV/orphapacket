Patients present with difficulty climbing stairs, a waddling gait, marked winging of scapula, lower back pain, paresis of limb girdle musculature, hypo-\/areflexia and\/or mild facial muscle weakness in rare cases. Respiratory muscle weakness is common and cardiac anomalies (conduction blocks, tachycardia, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy) have been reported in some cases."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"609524","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"filamin C"}],"Symbol":"FLNC","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"3756"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"102565"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
