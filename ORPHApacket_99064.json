Straddling mitral valve is usually associated with conotruncal anomalies, most commonly double outlet right ventricle or transposition of the great arteries. Overriding mitral valve is characterized by a mitral annulus committed to the two ventricular chambers, where the mitral valve is shared between the ventricles. Straddling and overriding mitral valve can occur together or in isolation."}]}]}
