It presents prenatally with cardiomegaly, polyhydramnios, fetal heart failure, hydrops fetalis and fetal demise or postnatally with cyanosis and respiratory failure due to bronchomalacia secondary to bronchial compression from dilated pulmonary arteries. It is frequently associated with 22q11 deletion."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Antenatal"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"APV\/ADA, Fallot type"},{"lang":"en","label":"Absence of pulmonary valve-Fallot tetralogy-absence of ductus arteriosus syndrome"},{"lang":"en","label":"PVA\/ADA, Fallot type"}]}]}]}
