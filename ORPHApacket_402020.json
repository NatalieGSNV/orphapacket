Bone marrow typically shows small, hypolobated megakaryocytes and multilineage dyslplasia. Patients typically present with leukocytosis, anemia, variable platelet counts and a variety of nonspecific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue, bleeding, bruising, recurrent infections, bone pain) and\/or extramedullary site involvement (gingivitis, splenomegaly).
