  - Contents: Inherited cancer-predisposing syndrome due to biallelic BRCA2 mutations
      is a rare cancer-predisposing syndrome, associated with the D1 subgroup of Fanconi
      anemia (FA), characterized by progressive bone marrow failure, cardiac, brain,
      intestinal or skeletal abnormalities and predisposition to various malignancies.
      Bone marrow suppression and the incidence of developmental abnormalities are
      less frequent than in other FA, but cancer risk is very high with the spectrum
      of childhood cancers including Wilms tumor, brain tumor (often medulloblastoma)
      and ALL/AML.
