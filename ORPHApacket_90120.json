Patients typically present distal limb muscle weakness and atrophy, hypo\/areflexia, foot deformities, poor visual acuity (often with a central scotoma), nystagmus, and reduced peripheral and nocturnal vision. Additional reported manifestations include sensorineural hearing loss, major joint contractures, anosmia, scoliosis\/lumbar hyperlordosis, cognitive impairment and vocal cord paresis."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"601152","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"616505","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"6","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"CMT6"},{"lang":"en","label":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 6"},{"lang":"en","label":"HMSN 6"},{"lang":"en","label":"HMSN VI"},{"lang":"en","label":"Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type VI"},{"lang":"en","label":"Peripheral neuropathy and optic atrophy"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"2","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"solute carrier family 25 member 46"}],"Symbol":"SLC25A46","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"25198"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"610826"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410295","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (loss of function) in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"mitofusin 2"}],"Symbol":"MFN2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"16877"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"608507"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
