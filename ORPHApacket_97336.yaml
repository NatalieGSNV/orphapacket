- TextSection:
  - Contents: Panner's disease is an osteochondrosis of the capitellum of the humerus,
      characterised by involvement of the dominant upper limb and onset before the
      age of 10 years. It results from lateral compression injuries of the elbow typically
      occurring in children practising sports such as baseball and throw. It should
      be distinguished from osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum (see this
      term), occurring later, in adolescents. Management is symptomatic and consists
      in reducing the activities of the affected elbow for a prolonged period of time.
      Prognosis is good.
