Pulmonary sporotrichosis occurs following inhalation of fungus and manifests as chronic pneumonitis while extracutaneous or systemic sporotrichosis (with osteoarticular, pulmonary, and central nervous system\/meningeal disease) has also been reported, usually occurring in the setting of immunosuppression."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
