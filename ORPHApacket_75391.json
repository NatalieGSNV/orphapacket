It has been described in four children from a large inbred kindred. Three out of the four children reported developed a viral illness. The mode of transmission is most likely autosomal recessive. The causative gene has been localised to within a 12-Mb region on chromosome 8p11.23-q11.21."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"609981","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Primary immunodeficiency due to MCM4 deficiency"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"minichromosome maintenance complex component 4"}],"Symbol":"MCM4","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"6947"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"602638"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
