It is often difficult to diagnose due to its similarity with other lymphoid diseases such as classic Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (see these terms) and has an aggressive clinical course."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"4","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Elderly"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Multigenic\/multifactorial"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"THRLBCL"}]}]}]}
