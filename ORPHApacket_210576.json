It is associated with variable degrees of facial dysmorphism (i.e. lateral deviation of the mandible and chin, lower facial asymmetry, retrognathia, micrognathia, dental malocclusion) and patients typically present with feeding and breathing difficulties. Developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and additional dysmorphic features (e.g. pectus excavatum, low-set ears, hypoplastic alae nasi) have also been reported."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Congenital trismus"}]}]}]}
