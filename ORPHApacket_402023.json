It occurs typically in infants and usually presents with hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia and nonspecific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoiesis (fatigue, bleeding and bruising, recurrent infections). Myelofibrosis and fibrosis of other infiltrated organs is also characteristic of this disease."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Megakaryoblastic AML with t(1;22)(p13;q13)"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"2","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"RNA binding motif protein 15"}],"Symbol":"RBM15","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"14959"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"606077"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317348","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Part of a fusion gene in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"myocardin related transcription factor A"}],"Symbol":"MRTFA","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"14334"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"606078"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317348","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Part of a fusion gene in"}]}]}]}]}]}
