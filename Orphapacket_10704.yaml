  - Contents: "Vasculitis represents a clinically heterogenous group of diseases of\
      \ multifactorial etiology characterized by inflammation of either large-sized\
      \ vessels (large-vessel vasculitis, e.g. Giant-cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis;\
      \ see these terms), medium-sized vessels (medium-vessel vasculitis e.g. polyarteritis\
      \ nodosa and Kawasaki disease; see these terms), or small-sized vessels (small-vessel\
      \ vasculitis, e.g. granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis,\
      \ immunoglobulin A vasculitis, and cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis; see\
      \ these terms). Vasculitis occurs at any age, may be acute or chronic, and manifests\
      \ with general symptoms such as fever, weight loss and fatigue, as well as more\
      \ specific clinical signs depending on the type of vessels and organs affected.\
      \ The degree of severity is variable, ranging from life or sight threatening\
      \ disease (e.g. Beh\xE7et disease, see this term) to relatively minor skin disease."
