It is characterized by a substantial keratinization with abundant keratohyalin pearls and central deposition of dense keratin material within infiltrative nests and locally aggressive nature. In the early stages of the disease symptoms are vague and nonspecific (abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting). In the advanced stages it may present with a bulky tumor and symptoms of adjacent organ involvement."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Squamous cell carcinoma of gallblader and EBT"}]}]}]}
