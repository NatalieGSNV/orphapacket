  - Contents: "Mal de d\xE9barquement (MdD) is a rare otorhinolaryngological disease\
      \ characterized by a persistent sensation of motion such as rocking, swaying,\
      \ tumbling and/or bobbing following a period of exposure to passive movement,\
      \ usually an ocean cruise or other types of water, train, automobile or air\
      \ travel and less commonly other movements (like sleeping on a waterbed). Onset\
      \ may be spontaneous in some patients. Manifestations begin shortly after the\
      \ stimulus, persist for 6 months to years and may be associated with anxiety,\
      \ fatigue and impaired cognition. Symptoms are often accentuated when in an\
      \ enclosed space or when attempting to be motionless (sitting, lying down or\
      \ standing in a stationary position) and are relieved when in passive motion\
      \ such as in a moving car, airplane or train."
