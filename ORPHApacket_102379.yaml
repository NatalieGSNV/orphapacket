  - Contents: Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes related to alkylating
      agent is a subgroup of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN), associated
      with a treatment of an unrelated neoplastic or autoimmune disease with cytotoxic
      agents, like cyclophosphamid, platins, melphalan and others. The neoplastic
      cells typically harbor unbalanced aberrations of chromosomes 5 and 7 (monosomy
      5/del(5q) and monosomy 7/del(7q)) or a complex karyotype. It usually presents
      with multilineage dysplasia and cytopenias 5-10 years after exposure, with symptoms
      related to the degree of bone marrow failure and the corresponding cytopenia
      (fatigue, bleeding and bruising, recurrent infections, bone pain).
