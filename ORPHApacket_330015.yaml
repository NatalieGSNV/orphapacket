- TextSection:
  - Contents: Lead poisoning is defined as acute or chronic exposure to lead resulting
      in lead accumulation (blood lead concentration (BLC) >5 ug/dL) that can affect
      every organ system in the body and to which children are more susceptible. Clinical
      manifestations depend on the amount and duration of exposure and include abdominal
      pain, colic, constipation, lead line on gingival tissue, arthralgia, myalgia,
      peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, irritability, anemia, chronic nephropathy and
      hypertension. In children, even low levels of exposure (BLC <5 ug/dL) is reported
      to lead to irreversible effects such as loss of cognition, shortening of attention
      span, alteration of behavior, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder, hypertension,
      renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to the reproductive organs.
