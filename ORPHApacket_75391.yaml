- TextSection:
  - Contents: The primary immunodeficiency with natural-killer cell deficiency and
      adrenal insufficiency is characterised by a specific natural-killer (NK) cell
      deficiency and susceptibility to viral diseases. It has been described in four
      children from a large inbred kindred. Three out of the four children reported
      developed a viral illness. The mode of transmission is most likely autosomal
      recessive. The causative gene has been localised to within a 12-Mb region on
      chromosome 8p11.23-q11.21.
