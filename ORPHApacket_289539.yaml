- TextSection:
  - Contents: BAP1-related tumor predisposition syndrome (TPDS) is an inherited cancer-predisposing
      syndrome, associated with germline mutations in BAP1 tumor suppressor gene.
      The most commonly observed cancer types include uveal melanoma, malignant mesothelioma,
      renal cell carcinoma, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, breast cancer and meningioma,
      with variable age of onset. Common cutaneous manifestations include malignant
      melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and benign melanocytic BAP1-mutated atypical
      intradermal tumors (MBAIT) presenting as multiple skin-coloured to reddish-brown
      dome-shaped to pedunculated, well-circumscribed papules with an average size
      of 5 mm, histologically predominantly composed of epithelioid melanocytes with
      abundant amphophilic cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli and large, vesicular nuclei
      that vary substantially in size and shape.
