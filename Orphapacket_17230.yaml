- TextSection:
  - Contents: Suprabasal epidermolysis bullosa simplex is a subtype of inherited epidermolysis
      bullosa simplex and comprises a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous
      conditions, with phenotype ranging from mild to severe, principally characterized
      by infantile, localized or generalized, superficial skin erosions due to blistering
      within the middle or upper epidermal layers. Features of ectodermal dysplasia
      are frequently associated and depending on the specific disorder, variable extracutaneous
      involvement may be observed.
