- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous
      origin of the left (ALCAPA) or right (ARCAPA) coronary artery from the pulmonary
      artery, with variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to early
      heart failure and death depending on the degree of development of collateral
      circulation between the left and right coronary artery systems, as well as the
      pressure level of the pulmonary artery. Infants typically present with feeding
      difficulties, failure to thrive, dyspnea, irritability, hyperhidrosis, heart
      murmurs, tachypnea, tachycardia and/or chest pain while adults usually associate
      dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and intolerance to physical exercise. Sudden death
      may occur due to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, valvular insufficiencies
      or ventricular arrhythmias. The majority of cases reported are of an ALCAPA,
      while ARCAPA is rarely observed.
