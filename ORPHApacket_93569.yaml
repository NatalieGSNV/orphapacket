  - Contents: A rare rheumatologic disease characterized by bilateral morning stiffness
      which lasts > 45-60 min of duration associated with a subacute-onset of severe
      pain with active movements, typically affecting the shoulders, proximal upper
      limbs, neck and/or, less commonly, the pelvic girdle and proximal aspects of
      thighs, which are exacerbated with inactivity and improve progressively over
      the day. Muscle tenderness, peripheral synovitis, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome
      or distal tenosynovitis, as well as non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue,
      asthenia, malaise, low-grade fever, anorexia and weight loss, may be associated.
      Acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) are
      increased.
