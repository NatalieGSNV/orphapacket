  - Contents: A rare, slow-growing uterine cancer characterized, histologically, by
      small, well differentiated nests of basaloid cells resembling basal cell carcinoma
      of the skin, commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma or squamous intraepithelial
      lesions. Patients are usually asymptomatic or present with dysfunctional vaginal
      bleeding, often with no observable lesion on the cervix. Infection with high-risk
      HPV-types (16 and 33) has been reported in some cases.
