- TextSection:
  - Contents: Anaplastic astrocytoma is a rare, high-grade, malignant glial tumor,
      histologically characterized by abundance of pleomorphic astrocytes and multiple
      mitotic figures, often associated with diffuse infiltration of the surrounding
      tissue, considerable edema and mass effect and involvement of the contralateral
      brain. Depending on the primary localization of the tumor, patients can present
      with signs of raised intracranial pressure (headache, vomiting, papilledema),
      seizures, progressive neurological deficits, and/or behavioral changes. The
      tumor is most commonly localized in the frontal and temporal lobes, brain stem
      and spinal cord.
