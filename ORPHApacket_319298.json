Symptoms related to metastatic spread, such as bone pain or persistent cough, are frequently associated since early diagnosis is not common. It is typically multifocal, bilateral, and in most cases sporadic, although different hereditary syndromes, such as Hereditary leiomyoma renal cell carcinoma, Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome and Tuberous sclerosis, may predispose to the development of papillary renal cell carcinoma."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Elderly"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Papillary renal cell adenocarcinoma"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"2","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase"}],"Symbol":"MET","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"7029"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"164860"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317344","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing somatic mutation(s) in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"melanocyte inducing transcription factor"}],"Symbol":"MITF","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"7105"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"156845"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317345","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Major susceptibility factor in"}]}]}]}]}]}
