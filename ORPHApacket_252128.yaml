  - Contents: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with perineurial differentiation
      is a rare soft tissue sarcoma composed predominantly of spindle-shaped neoplastic
      cells showing perineurial differentiation and displaying abundant cellular pleomorphism
      or anaplasia, frequent mitoses, tumor necrosis and high metastatic potential.
      It often presents as a soft, painless, solid mass in subcutaneous tissues of
      the trunk or limbs, but tumors have also been described in the facial area,
      mediastinum, retroperitoneum, pancreas, paravertebral column and the pelvic
      soft tissues. Frequent local recurrence and distant metastatic spread has been
      reported.
