In a systematic study of coarctation, familial aggregation was considered as result of multifactorial inheritance and recurrence risks in sibs was evaluated at about 0.5% for coarctation and 1.0% for any form of congenital heart defect. Nevertheless, in some of the described families, aortic coarctations seems to be inherited as an autosomal dominant mutation."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"5","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0001629","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001629","HPOTerm":"Ventricular septal defect","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001643","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001643","HPOTerm":"Patent ductus arteriosus","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0004383","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0004383","HPOTerm":"Hypoplastic left heart","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0005113","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0005113","HPOTerm":"Dilatation of the aortic arch","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0012303","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0012303","HPOTerm":"Abnormality of the aortic arch","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
