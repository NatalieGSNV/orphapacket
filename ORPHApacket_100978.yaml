      craniosynostosis characterized by prenatal presentation with cloverleaf skull,
      micromelia and asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia. Radiologic features include
      short ribs, horizontal roof of the acetabulum with a rounded median prominence
      and lateral spurs, deformed long bones with broad metaphyses, and absent ossification
      of the terminal phalanges. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
