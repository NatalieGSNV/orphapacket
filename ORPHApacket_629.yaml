- TextSection:
  - Contents: Short stature due to growth hormone qualitative anomaly is characterised
      by growth retardation and short stature (despite the presence of normal or slightly
      elevated levels of immunoreactive growth hormone, GH), low concentrations of
      insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and a significant increase in growth rate
      following recombinant GH therapy. Prevalence is unknown but only a few cases
      have been reported in the literature. The syndrome is caused by various mutations
      in the <i>GH1</i> gene (17q22-q24) that result in structural GH anomalies and
      a biologically inactive molecule. Transmission is autosomal recessive.
