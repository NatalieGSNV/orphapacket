SHFM can be an isolated malformation or can be a feature in various syndromes (ADULT syndrome, EEC syndrome; see these terms). SHFM usually follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance, but autosomal recessive and rarely X-linked inheritance have also been reported."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"6","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"183600","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"225300","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"246560","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"313350","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"605289","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"606708","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"3","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"X-linked recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Ectrodactyly"},{"lang":"en","label":"SHFM"},{"lang":"en","label":"Split hand foot malformation"}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"6","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000407","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000407","HPOTerm":"Sensorineural hearing impairment","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000526","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000526","HPOTerm":"Aniridia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001171","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001171","HPOTerm":"Split hand","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0004050","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0004050","HPOTerm":"Absent hand","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0006101","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0006101","HPOTerm":"Finger syndactyly","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0012165","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0012165","HPOTerm":"Oligodactyly","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
