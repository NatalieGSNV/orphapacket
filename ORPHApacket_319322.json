Patients can present abdominal\/flank pain, adbominal mass and\/or hematuria, however most are asymptomatic and tumor is discovered incidentally. Indolent behavior is frequent and association with nephrolithiasis and end-stage kidney disease has been noted."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"3","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adolescent"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Adult"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Elderly"}]}]}]}]}
