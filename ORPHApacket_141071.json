Depending mostly on size and location of the cyst, patients could be asymptomatic or could present a wide array of symptoms, such as varying degrees of respiratory and feeding difficulties, lingual swelling and protrusion, dysphagia, and more rarely, recurrent bleeding or brownish discharge from a lingual sinus."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Enteric duplication cyst of the tongue"},{"lang":"en","label":"Foregut duplication cyst of the tongue"},{"lang":"en","label":"Gastric duplication cyst of the tongue"}]}]}]}
