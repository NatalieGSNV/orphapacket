It is occasionally associated with chest pain or dyspnea and is usually incidentally diagnosed during surgery or at autopsy. Herniation and strangulation of a portion of the heart through the pericardial foramen may occur, resulting in myocardial acute ischemia and possible sudden death. Right side pericardium involvement is rare."}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
