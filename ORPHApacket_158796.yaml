- TextSection:
  - Contents: Classic mast cell leukemia is a very rare, aggressive form of systemic
      mastocytosis characterized by abnormal growth and proliferation of neoplastic
      mast cells (>20%) in the bone marrow and/or blood, as well as other tissues
      such as the liver, peritoneum, spleen or bones. Patients typically present with
      symptoms related to mast cell activation (e.g. hot flushes, fever, malaise,
      diarrhea, tachycardia), weight loss, anorexia, hepatosplenomegaly or, less frequently,
      cutaneous mastocytosis. Gastroduodenal ulcers (often complicated by hemorrhage),
      ascites and portal hypertension have also been reported.
