- TextSection:
  - Contents: Sporotrichosis is an infection caused by the dimorphic fungus <i>Sporothrix
      schenckii</i>, generally occurring by traumatic inoculation of fungus from contaminated
      soil, plants, and organic matter, that has a highly variable disease spectrum
      but that usually presents as a subcutaneous mycosis with a single sporotrichotic
      chancre that may ulcerate and can then progress to lymphocutaneous (most common
      form; sporotrichotic chancre at inoculation site and a string of similar nodules
      along the proximal lymphatics), fixed cutaneous (localized asymptomatic, erythematous,
      papules at the inoculation site), or multifocal or disseminated cutaneous (rare
      form, with 3 or more lesions involving 2 different anatomical sites) forms.
      Pulmonary sporotrichosis occurs following inhalation of fungus and manifests
      as chronic pneumonitis while extracutaneous or systemic sporotrichosis (with
      osteoarticular, pulmonary, and central nervous system/meningeal disease) has
      also been reported, usually occurring in the setting of immunosuppression.
