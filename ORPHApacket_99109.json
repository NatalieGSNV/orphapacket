Patients are usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, however hypoxia, cyanosis, murmurs, palpitations, cardiac structural anomalies (e.g. atrial septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve, cor triatrium) and risk of paradoxical embolization may be associated."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Persistent left SVC connecting through coronary sinus to left-sided atrium"}]}]}]}
