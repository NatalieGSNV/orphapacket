The disease is characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid blasts harboring mutations of the <i>NPM1<\/i> gene in the bone marrow, blood and other tissues. It is associated with multilineage dysplasia, involving the myeloid, monocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cell lineages."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"AML with NPM1 somatic mutations"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"nucleophosmin 1"}],"Symbol":"NPM1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"7910"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"164040"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317344","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing somatic mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
