- TextSection:
  - Contents: Endocrine tumours, also referred to as neuroendocrine tumours (NETs),
      are defined by a common phenotype which is characterized by the expression of
      general markers (neuron specific enolase, chromogranin, synaptophysin) and hormone
      secretion products. These tumours may be localized in any part of the body and
      are generally discovered in non-specific situations, i.e. not immediately suggestive
      of NETs (tests for inherited predisposition to tumours or for a clinical syndrome
      caused by abnormal hormone secretion).
