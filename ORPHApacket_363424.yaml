  - Contents: "A rare neurometabolic disease, due to a lipoic acid biosynthesis defect,\
      \ with a highly variable phenotype, typically characterized by early-onset acute\
      \ or subacute developmental delay or regression frequently associated with feeding\
      \ difficulties. Clinical severity is variable and may range from mild cases\
      \ which present a later onset with slow neurological deterioration and general\
      \ improvement over time to severe cases with clinical signs since birth and\
      \ leading to early death. Associated manifestations include hypotonia, vision\
      \ loss, respiratory failure, seizures, and intellectual disability. Brain magnetic\
      \ resonance imaging frequently shows cavitating leukoencephalopathy with lesions\
      \ in the periventricular/central white matter and parieto-occi\xC3\xAEtal lobes."
