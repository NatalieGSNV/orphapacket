- TextSection:
  - Contents: X-linked mixed deafness with perilymphatic gusher, also known as X-linked
      deafness type 2, is a rare form of non-syndromic genetic deafness affecting
      males and characterized by pathognomonic inner ear anomalies and conductive
      and profound sensorineural hearing loss. The inner ear anomalies are described
      as dilatation of the internal auditory meatus and fistulous connection between
      the cochlear basal turn and internal auditory canal resulting in perilympatic
      gusher on attempted mobilization of a fixed stapes. Obligate female carriers
      may suffer from mild to moderate hearing loss.
