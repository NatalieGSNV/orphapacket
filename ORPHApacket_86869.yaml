- TextSection:
  - Contents: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) is a very rare Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV)-driven lymphoproliferative disease most commonly occurring in adults (in
      the fourth to sixth decade of life) and commonly affecting the lungs (with presentations
      varying from small bilateral pulmonary nodules to large necrotic and sometimes
      cavitating lesions), skin, central nervous system, and kidneys, but only very
      rarely affecting the lymph nodes and spleen. The symptoms associated with LYG
      depend on the site of disease involvement but mainly include cough, dyspnea
      or chest pain (in those with pulmonary involvement) and constitutional symptoms
      such as weight loss and fever.
