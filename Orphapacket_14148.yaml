- TextSection:
  - Contents: Pleuro-pericardial cyst is a rare, mostly congenital, pericardium anomaly
      characterized by the presence of, usually asymptomatic, cysts which are typically
      located in the right costophrenic angle and are usually incidentally diagnosed.
      On occasion, it manifests with chest pain, dyspnea, tachycardia, persistent
      cough or cardiac arrhythmias. The condition is usually benign, but rare complications,
      such as cardiac tamponade, cardiogenic shock, mitral valve prolapse, hoarseness
      atrial fibrillation, right ventricular outflow, tract obstruction, spontaneous
      internal hemorrhage, pulmonary stenosis and sudden death, may occur.
