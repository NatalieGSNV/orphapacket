Hemimegalencephaly may be an isolated finding or associated with other syndromes such as angioosteohypertrophic syndrome, epidermal nevus syndrome and Ito hypomelanosis (see these terms). Management includes seizure control by antiepileptic medications and early hemispherectomy."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Unilateral megalencephaly"}]}]}]}
