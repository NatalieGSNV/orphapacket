  - Contents: A foodborne zoonotic disease, endemic to Southeast Asia and the Pacific
      Islands, caused by the rat lungworm <i>Angiostrongylus cantonensis</i> and that
      is acquired by the ingestion of the infective larvae on vegetables or in raw
      or undercooked snails, slugs, land crabs, freshwater shrimps, frogs and lizards.
      The main feature is eosinophilic meningitis, with clinical manifestations including
      fever, headache, malaise, fatigue, vomiting, rhinorrhea, blurred vision, diplopia,
      cough, stiff neck, enteritis, constipation and paraesthesia due to the movement
