- TextSection:
  - Contents: Mansonellosis is a mild form of filariasis (see this term), distributed
      throughout sub-Saharan Africa as well as in some locations of Central and South
      America and the Caribbean, caused by the parasitic worms <i>Mansonella perstans</i>
      and <i>Mansonella ozzardi</i>. The disease is often asymptomatic but may also
      cause fever, vertigo, myalgias, arthralgias and a sensation of coldness in the
      legs. Additional features include neuropsychiatric symptoms, skin rash, pruritus,
      nodules containing adult worms (in the conjunctiva or eyelids), lymphadenopathy,
      recurrent lymphedema in the limbs and face (resembling the Calabar swellings
      of loasis (see this term)), severe abdominal pain and endocrine disturbances.
