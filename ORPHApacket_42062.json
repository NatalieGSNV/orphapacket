The prevalence is estimated at around 1 in 15 000. The disorder is usually asymptomatic and is identified fortuitously by detection of increased levels of the imino acids and glycine in the urine. It is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"242600","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"4","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"solute carrier family 6 member 20"}],"Symbol":"SLC6A20","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"30927"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"605616"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"327767","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Candidate gene tested in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"solute carrier family 36 member 2"}],"Symbol":"SLC36A2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"18762"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"608331"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"solute carrier family 6 member 18"}],"Symbol":"SLC6A18","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"26441"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"610300"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"327767","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Candidate gene tested in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"solute carrier family 6 member 19"}],"Symbol":"SLC6A19","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"27960"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"608893"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"327767","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Candidate gene tested in"}]}]}]}]}]}
