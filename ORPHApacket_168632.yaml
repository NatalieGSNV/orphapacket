- TextSection:
  - Contents: Generalized basaloid follicular hamartoma syndrome is a rare, genetic
      skin disease characterized by multiple milium-like, comedone-like lesions and
      skin-colored to hyperpigmented, 1 to 2 mm-sized papules, associated with hypotrichosis
      and palmar/plantar pits. Lesions are usually first noticed on cheeks or neck
      and gradually increase in size and number to involve the scalp, face, ears,
      shoulders, chest, axillas, and upper arms. In severe cases, lower back, lower
      arms, and back of the legs can be involved. Mild hypohidrosis has also been
      reported.
