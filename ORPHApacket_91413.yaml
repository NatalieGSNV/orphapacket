- TextSection:
  - Contents: Congenital Horner syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized
      by relative pupillary miosis and blepharoptosis, evident at birth, caused by
      interruption of the oculosympathetic innervation at any point along the neural
      pathway from the hypothalamus to the orbit. Often additional symptoms, such
      as enophthalmos, facial anhidrosis, iris heterochromia, conjunctival congestion,
      transient hypotonia and/or pupillary dilation lag, may be present. Association
      with birth trauma, neoplasms or vascular malformations has been reported.
