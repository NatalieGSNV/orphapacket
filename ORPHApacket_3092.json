It comprises three anatomical subforms: discrete fixed membranous subaortic stenosis (membranous tissue encircling the LVOT), discrete fibromuscular subaortic stenosis (fibromuscular tissue encircling the LVOT) and tunnel subaortic stenosis (fibromuscular diffuse tunnel-like narrowing of the LVOT), the two latter forms being generally more severe than the membranous form."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"271950","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"No data available"}]}]}]}]}
