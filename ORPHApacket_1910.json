Iodine deficiency is associated with goiter and hypothyroidism. When severe iodine deficiency occurs during pregnancy, it is associated with congenital hypothyroidism that is manifested by increased neonatal morbi-mortality and severe mental dysfunction, hyperactivity, attention disorders and a substantial decrease of IQ of an irreversible nature. Excessive iodine ingestion during the third trimester of pregnancy can result in hypothyroidism and fetal goiter due to a prolonged inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis, an increase in thyrotropin (TSH)."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"228355","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Antenatal"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"7","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000407","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000407","HPOTerm":"Sensorineural hearing impairment","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000486","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000486","HPOTerm":"Strabismus","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000639","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000639","HPOTerm":"Nystagmus","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453313","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Occasional (29-5%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0000821","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000821","HPOTerm":"Hypothyroidism","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453312","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Frequent (79-30%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001249","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001249","HPOTerm":"Intellectual disability","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001264","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001264","HPOTerm":"Spastic diplegia","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0004374","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0004374","HPOTerm":"Hemiplegia\/hemiparesis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
