- TextSection:
  - Contents: Microcephalic primordial dwarfism, Alazami type is a rare, genetic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability,
      distinct dysmorphic facial features (i.e. triangular face with prominent forehead,
      narrow palpebral fissures, deep-set eyes, low-set ears, broad nose, malar hypoplasia,
      short philtrum, macrostomia, widely spaced teeth) and pre and postnatal proportionate
      short stature, ranging from primordial dwarfism (height below -3.5 SD) to a
      milder phenotype with less severe growth restriction (height below -2.5 SD).
      Other reported features include skeletal findings (e.g. scoliosis), microcephaly,
      involuntary hand movements, hypersensitivity to stimuli and behavioral problems,
      such as anxiety.
