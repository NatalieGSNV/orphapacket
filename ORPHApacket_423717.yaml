- TextSection:
  - Contents: Cutaneous larva migrans is a rare parasitic disease characterized by
      single or multiple, linear or serpinginous, erythematous, slightly elevated
      cutaneous tracks caused by the larval migration of various nematode species.
      Tracks are variable in length, generally a few millimeters wide and are frequently
      located on the feet (although any area of the body is possible). Patients typically
      present with severe, intractable pruritus, which, in some cases, may cause impaired
      concentration, loss of sleep, and mood disturbances.
