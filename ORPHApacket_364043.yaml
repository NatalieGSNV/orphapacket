  - Contents: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      is a very rare variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; see this term)
      mainly affecting middle-aged immunocompetent men and characterized by a consistent
      primary involvement of lymph nodes (mainly in the cervical and mediastinum lymph
      nodes) and with infrequent extra nodal involvement of the bone marrow and other
      extra-nodal sites (head and neck region, liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal
      tract). It has an aggressive disease course, and is associated with a poor prognosis.
