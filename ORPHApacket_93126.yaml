- TextSection:
  - Contents: Pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (GN) is one of the most frequent causes
      of rapidly progressive GN (RPGN, see this term). It is characterized clinically
      by renal manifestations of RPGN (hematuria, hypertension) leading to renal failure
      within days or weeks, and may be associated with manifestations of systemic
      vasculitis (arthralgia, fever, seizures, mono neuritis and lung involvement).
      Pauci-immune GN is histologically characterized by focal necrotizing and crescentic
      GN, with mild or absent glomerular staining for immunoglobulin and complement
      by fluorescence microscopy, which may manifest either as part of a systemic
      small vessel vasculitis (including microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis
      with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (see these
      terms)), or rarely as part of renal-limited vasculitis (RLV, idiopathic crescentic
      GN). Immunologic classification is based on the presence or absence of circulating
      anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), namely pauci-immune-GN with
      ANCA and pauci-immune GN without ANCA (see these terms).
