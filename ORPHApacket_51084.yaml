- TextSection:
  - Contents: Torsade-de-pointes (TdP) syndrome with short coupling interval is a
      very rare variant of Torsade de pointes, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,
      which is characterized by a short coupling interval of the first TdP beat on
      electrocardiogram in the absence of any structural heart disease. It manifests
      in early adulthood with syncope, often results in ventricular fibrillation and
      shows a high risk of sudden cardiac death.
