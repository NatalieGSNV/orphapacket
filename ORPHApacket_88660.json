During pregnancy, there is a marked exacerbation of hypertension, accompanied by low serum potassium levels and undetectable aldosterone levels, but without signs of preeclampsia, requiring early delivery."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"605115","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Early-onset hypertension with exacerbation in pregnancy"},{"lang":"en","label":"Pseudohyperaldosteronism type 2"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2"}],"Symbol":"NR3C2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"600983"},{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"7979"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410296","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (gain of function) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
