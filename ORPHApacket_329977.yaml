      of the appendix (see this term), seen twice as frequently in females than in
      males, and usually presenting before the fifth decade of life. Classic endocrine
      tumor of the appendix is usually asymptomatic when located in the tip of the
      appendix (without obstruction), but acute appendicitis is often associated.
