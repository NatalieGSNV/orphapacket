  - Contents: A rare vulvovaginal tumor characterized by intraepithelial neoplastic
      proliferation of the vulvar epithelium, histologically presenting proliferation
      of atypical basal cells with basal layer involvement, enlarged nuclei, hyperchromasia,
      pleomorphic cells and increased numbers of mitotic figures. Patients are frequently
      asymptomatic, although vulvar pruritis/pain/burning, dysuria and/or dyspareunia
      may be associated. Concurrent anogenital involvement is frequent. Two subtypes,
      usual type VIN (uVIN) and differentiated type VIN (dVIN) exist, with uVIN typically
      being associated with HPV infection and presenting multifocal, elevated lesions
      around the introitus and/or labia majora, and dVIN being related to chronic
      inflammation and lesions consisting of poorly demarcated pink or white plaques
      that are often associated with lichen sclerosis or lichen planus. Diffusely
      positive p16 immunohistochemistry and high Ki-67 proliferation index in uVIN
      futher differentiates this subtype from dVIN, this latter being consistently
      negative for p16 while presenting p53 positivity.
