Additional variable manifestations include hearing impairment, ocular lesions, skeletal anomalies (e.g. talipes equinovarus, overriding toes, scoliosis, joint contractures), cryptorchidism, and dysmorphic features (such as coarse facies, hypertelorism, high-arched palate). Outcome is typically poor due to respiratory insufficiency and\/or aspiration pneumonia."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}]}]}
