- TextSection:
  - Contents: Cat-scratch disease is a rare infectious disease, caused by the Gram-negative
      bacteria <i>Bartonella henselae</i>, that is transmitted to humans via a scratch
      or bite of an infected cat and that has a variable clinical presentation but
      that usually manifests with an erythematous papule at the site of inoculation
      followed by chronic regional lymphadenopathy. Clinical course is usually self-limiting
      but disseminated illness with high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, granulomatous
      osteolytic lesions, encephalitis, retinitis, and atypical pneumonia can also
      occur. Cat-scratch disease can atypically present as parinaud oculoglandular
      syndrome (unilateral conjunctivitis and preauricular lymphadenopathy).
