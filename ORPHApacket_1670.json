Partial villous atrophy (with eosinophilic infiltration) is observed on intestinal biopsy. Although diarrhea may resolve, the development of neurologic symptoms (cerebellar ataxia, sensorineural deafness, seizures), retinitis pigmentosa and muscle weakness may complicate disease course and lead to death. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1994."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"520100","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]}]}]}]}
