- TextSection:
  - Contents: Cysticercosis is a parasitic infectious disease characterized by cyst
      formation in the target tissue of <i>Taenia solium</i> (tapeworm) parasite larvae
      ingested via the feces of a human with a tapeworm (human-to-human fecal-oral
      transmission) leading to variable clinical manifestations in muscle, the brain,
      spinal cord, and eyes. Infection of muscle tissue is generally asymptomatic.
      Cyst development in the brain and spinal cord is known as neurocysticercosis
      (NCC) and may cause seizures and headache. NCC can follow a serious course and
      may be life-threatening. Severe cases of cysticercosis are treated with albendazole
      and anti-inflammatory drugs.
