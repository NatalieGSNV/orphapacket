It has been described in three members of a family (the grandfather, his daughter and grandson). It is likely to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. The acronym GEMSS (Glaucoma, Ectopia, Microspherophakia, Stiff joints, Short stature) was proposed as a name for the syndrome. This syndrome shows similarities to Moore-Federman syndrome (see this term)."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"608328","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"GEMSS syndrome"}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"3","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0000501","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0000501","HPOTerm":"Glaucoma","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001083","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001083","HPOTerm":"Ectopia lentis","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0004322","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0004322","HPOTerm":"Short stature","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
