- TextSection:
  - Contents: Borderline epithelial tumor of the ovary is an uncommon epithelial ovarian
      neoplasm, distinguished from ovarian carcinomas by the absence of destructive
      stromal invasion, generally characterized by indolent behavior and excellent
      prognosis. Most patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and the
      symptoms, if present, are often nonspecific and vague, such as pelvic pain,
      abdominal mass or, rarely, gastrointestinal problems including early satiety
      or bloating. Six histological subtypes are currently recognized, based on the
      epithelial cell type.
