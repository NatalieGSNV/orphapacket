  - Contents: A rare, indolent primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma characterized by
      multifocal, red to violaceous papules, plaques or nodules localized predominantly
      on the trunk and extremities. Histologically, these are dermis infiltrates consisting
      of small, marginal zone B cells, lymphoplasmacytic cells, and plasma cells.
      Marginal zone B cells express CD20, CD79a and Bcl-2, and are negative for CD5,
      CD10 and Bcl-6. Plasma cells are typically located at the periphery, and express
      CD138, CD79a, and monotypic light chains.
