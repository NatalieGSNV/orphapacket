  - Contents: Interstitial lung disease due to ABCA3 deficiency is a rare genetic
      respiratory disease characterized by a variable clinical outcome ranging from
      a fatal respiratory distress syndrome in the neonatal period to chronic interstitial
      lung disease developing in infancy or childhood with chronic cough, rapid breathing,
      shortness of breath and recurrent pulmonary infections. Clinical manifestations
      of respiratory failure include grunting, intercostal retractions, nasal flaring,
      cyanosis, and progressive dyspnea.
