It may be isolated or related to some syndromes (e.g. Beckwith-Wiedemann, Proteus, Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber, McCune-Albright syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1). It may be associated with airway obstruction, sensorineural hearing loss or swallowing difficulties."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"133900","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Hemifacial hypertrophy"}]}]}]}
