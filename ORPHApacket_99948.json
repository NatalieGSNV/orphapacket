Nerve conduction velocities range from very slow to normal. Apart from the typical CMT phenotype (distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, frequent pes cavus foot deformity), patients commonly present delayed motor development, vocal cord paresis, mild sensory loss, abolished deep tendon reflexes, and skeletal deformities."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"214400","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"CMT4A"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"ganglioside induced differentiation associated protein 1"}],"Symbol":"GDAP1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"15968"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"606598"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
