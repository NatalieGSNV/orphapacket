  - Contents: X-linked calvarial hyperostosis is a rare, genetic, primary bone dysplasia
      with increased bone density disorder characterized by benign, isolated, calvarial
      thickening, presenting with prominent frontoparietal bones, a high forehead
      with ridging of the metopic and sagittal sutures, lateral frontal prominences,
      and facial dysmorphism comprising a flat nasal root and short, upturned nose.
      Increased intracranial pressure and cranial nerve entrapment are not associated.
      There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1986.
