Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are increased between episodes of myoglobinuria. Less than 50 cases have been described so far. The disease is due to an anomaly in one of the last steps of glycolysis. The enzymatic defect in PGAMD is caused by mutations in the cDNA coding for the M-isoform of PGAM. Residual PGAM activity in the muscles of patients (2%-6%) is due to activity of the B-isoform. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Differential diagnosis includes muscle phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) and phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFKD) (see these terms)."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"261670","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"5","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"GSD due to phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency"},{"lang":"en","label":"GSD type 10"},{"lang":"en","label":"Glycogenosis due to phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency"},{"lang":"en","label":"Muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency"},{"lang":"en","label":"Myopathy due to phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"phosphoglycerate mutase 2"}],"Symbol":"PGAM2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"8889"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"612931"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
