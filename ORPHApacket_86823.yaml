  - Contents: Lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH) is a variant form of
      lissencephaly and involves a heterogeneous group of cortical malformations without
      severe congenital microcephaly (>-3 SD). LCH is characterized by cerebellar
      underdevelopment ranging from vermian hypoplasia to total aplasia with classical
      or cobblestone lissencephaly. The phenotypic features of LCH include small head
      circumference (between -2 and -3 standard deviations (SD) forage) at birth and
      postnatally, moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia and spasticity.
      Seizures are often observed and infantile spasms have been reported in some
      rare cases. LCH has been classified into six subgroups according to neuroradiographic
      properties and are classified LCH type A to F.
