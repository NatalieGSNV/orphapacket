Slit-lamp examination reveals typical confluent translucent subepithelial deposits, extending in size and growing into clusters of golden droplets covering the cornea with disease progression. Patients present variably compromised visual acuity, depending on the stage of the disease. In advanced stages, decreased corneal sensation may lead to corneal trophic changes, perforation, and permanent visual loss."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Honey-droplet corneal dystrophy"}]}]}]}
