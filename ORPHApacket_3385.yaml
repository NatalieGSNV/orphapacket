  - Contents: Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also called sleeping sickness,
      is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by a protozoa of the <i>Trypanosoma</i>
      genus transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly (genus <i>Glossina</i>), that
      is found under its chronic form (average duration of 3 years) in western and
      central Africa (in case of the <i>T. brucei gambiense</i> sub-species), and
      under its acute form (lasting from few weeks to 6 months) in eastern and southern
      Africa (in case of the <i>T. brucei rhodesiense</i> sub-species). HAT comprises
      an initial hemo-lymphatic stage characterized by fever, weakness, musculoskeletal
      pain, anemia, and lymphadenopathy, along with dermatologic, cardiac and endocrine
      complications or hepatosplenomegaly, followed by a meningo-encephalitic stage
      characterized by neurologic involvement (sleep disturbances, psychiatric disorders,
      seizures) that progresses, in the absence of treatment, towards a fatal meningoencephalitis.
