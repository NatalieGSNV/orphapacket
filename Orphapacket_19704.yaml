  - Contents: Ganglioglioma is a rare, usually benign, well-circumscribed, often cystic,
      mixed neuronal-glial tumor (composed of both neoplastic glial and ganglionic
      elements) which is typically located in the temporal lobe and rarely invades
      the surrounding tissue. Patients usually present with seizures refractory to
      medical treatment. Association with neurofibromatosis type I and tuberous sclerosis
      has been reported.
