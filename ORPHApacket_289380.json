Patients typically present thin, sclerotic muscles with a woody consistency, mild girdle and proximal limb weakness with moderate distal weakness and scoliosis. Muscle biopsy shows partial collagen VI deficiency at the myofiber basement membrane and absent collagen VI around most endomysial\/perimysial capillaries."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"255600","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Congenital myosclerosis, L\u00c3\u00b6wenthal type"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"collagen type VI alpha 2 chain"}],"Symbol":"COL6A2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"2212"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"120240"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
