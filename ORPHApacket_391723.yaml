- TextSection:
  - Contents: Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix is a very rare, slow growing,
      well-differentiated epithelial neoplasm of the appendix characterized by abundant
      mucin production. Clinically, it presents as acute appendicitis (with abdominal
      pain, fever, leukocytosis) or as pseudomyxoma peritonei (wide-spread presence
      of mucin within the peritoneal cavity), however some patients may be completely
      asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. In many cases, a second gastrointestinal
      malignancy is present.
