- TextSection:
  - Contents: Congenital patent ductus arteriosus aneurysm is a rare, congenital,
      arterial duct anomaly characterized by a saccular dilatation of the ductus arteriosus.
      It is often asymptomatic or presents shortly after birth with respiratory distress,
      stridor, cyanosis and/or weak cry. Complications, such as rupture, thromboembolism,
      infection, airway erosion and/or compression of the adjacent thoracic structures,
      can develop. Spontaneous resolution has been reported.
