- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngological malformation characterized by a dermoid
      cyst along the nasal dorsum or glabella, lined by keratinized squamous epithelium
      and containing intraluminal keratin and mature adnexal structures, such as hair
      follicles, sebaceous and sweat glands. The majority of nasal dermoid cysts are
      superficial, rarely they extend intracranially. The cysts are typically benign
      but are susceptible to recurrent infections that may progress to osteomyelitis,
      meningitis or an intracranial abscess.
