- TextSection:
  - Contents: Fetal carbamazepine syndrome is a drug-related embryofetopathy that
      can occur when an embryo/fetus is exposed to carbamazepine and that is characterized
      by facial dysmorphism, with some similarities to that seen in fetal valproate
      syndrome (see this term), such as epicanthal folds, upward slanting palpebral
      fissures, short nose, micrognathia and malar hypoplasia, as well as nail dysplasia
      and major anomalies including cleft lip/palate, neural tube defects and cardiac
      anomalies. <i>In utero</i> exposure to carbamazepine, in combination with valproate,
      has been associated with significant developmental delay (particularly affecting
      verbal intelligence) and a high rate of congenital anomalies.
