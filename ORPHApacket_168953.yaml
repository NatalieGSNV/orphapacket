- TextSection:
  - Contents: A rare, malignant, neoplastic disease characterized by clonal proliferation
      of myeloid and/or lymphoid precursors harboring translocations or insertions
      involving the chromosome band 8p11 and the FGFR1 gene, in the blood, bone marrow
      and often other tissues as well (spleen, liver, lymph nodes, breast, etc.).
      It usually presents as myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia, T lymphoblastic
      lymphoma with eosinophilia or, less frequently, acute myeloid leukemia. The
      presenting signs and symptoms include eosinophilia, leukocytosis with leukemoid
      reaction, monocytosis, fatigue, sweating, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly
      and/or hepatomegaly. Extranodal involvement may include the tonsils, lungs and
      breasts.
