Neurologic symptoms, such as cranial nerve palsies, myelopathy, neuralgia, radiculopathy, paraparesis or paraplegia, may be associated if the spine is involved. Imaging reveals a lytic (or mixed lytic and blastic) lesion with a radiolucent nidus (> 2 cm) associated with reactive sclerotic bone."}]}]}
