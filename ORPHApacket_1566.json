The Dandy-Walker malformation has a variable expression and is characterized by a posterior fossa cyst communicating with the fourth ventricle, the partial or complete absence of the cerebellar vermis, and facultative hydrocephalus. Postaxial polydactyly includes tetramelic postaxial polydactyly of hands and feet with possible enlargement of the fifth metacarpal and metatarsal bones, as well as bifid fifth metacarpals."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"220220","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Antenatal"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"DWM with postaxial polydactyly"},{"lang":"en","label":"Pierquin syndrome"}]}],"HPODisorderAssociationList":[{"count":"2","HPODisorderAssociation":[{"HPOId":"HP:0001162","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001162","HPOTerm":"Postaxial hand polydactyly","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]},{"HPOId":"HP:0001305","PURL":"http:\/\/purl.obolibrary.org\/obo\/HP_0001305","HPOTerm":"Dandy-Walker malformation","HPOFrequency":[{"ORPHA":"453311","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Very frequent (99-80%)"}]}]}]}],"HPODisorderSetStatus":[{"ValidationStatus":"y"}]}]}
