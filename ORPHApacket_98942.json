Patients usually present reduced vision and have an increased risk for retinal detachment. Other ocular anomalies (e.g. coloboma of iris, microcornea, nystagmus, strabismus, microphthalmos) are usually associated, however it may also be isolated."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"120200","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21534","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"NTBT (narrower term maps to a broader term)"}]}]}]}]}]}
