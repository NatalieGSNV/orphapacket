Patients typically develop foot drop, pes varus, hammer toes and claw hands. Pyramidal tract signs (such as brisk knee reflexes and positive Babinski sign) with absent ankle reflexes are initially associated but regress as disease stabilizes (~10 years after onset)."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"605726","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive distal spinal muscular atrophy type 2"},{"lang":"en","label":"dHMNJ"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1"}],"Symbol":"SIGMAR1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"8157"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"601978"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
