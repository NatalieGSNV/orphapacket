Clinical presentation is similar to the sporadic form and may range from neonatal-onset tachypnea, diaphoresis and failure to thrive to adult-onset atrial arrhythmia, signs and symptoms of heart failure and cyanosis limited to the lower extremities."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"3","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"607411","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"617035","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"617039","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}]}]}
