- TextSection:
  - Contents: Human pneumocystosis is caused by an infectious agent, which (after
      recent nomenclature and taxonomy revisions) is now classed as the fungus <i>Pneumocystis
      jiroveci</i>. The prevalence is unknown. <i>Pneumocystis jiroveci</i> is an
      opportunistic infectious agent, developing in immunosuppressed patients. It
      is an air-borne infection, localised to the lungs. However, extrapulmonary involvement
      is seen in AIDS patients. The disease manifests progressively with coughing,
      respiratory problems (dyspnea) and fever, followed by acute respiratory insufficiency
      and death within a few weeks in untreated cases. The most reliable diagnostic
      method is bronchoalveolar lavage. The treatment of choice is cotrimoxazole.
