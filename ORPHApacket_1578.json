Neurological developement is normal with dietary control of blood phenyalanine. PCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"264070","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"3","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Hyperphenylalaninemia due to dehydratase deficiency"},{"lang":"en","label":"Hyperphenylalaninemia due to pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase deficiency"},{"lang":"en","label":"Hyperphenylalaninemia with primapterinuria"}]}]}]}
