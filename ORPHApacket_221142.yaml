      tissue characterized by multiple, asymptomatic, well demarcated, flat, hypopigmented
      atrophic macular skin lesions distributed over upper trunk and proximal upper
      limbs. Histopathological examination reveals atrophic epidermis with decreased

      and disorganized, hyalinized, coarse collagen bundles, and variable loss of
      elastic fibers in the dermis.
