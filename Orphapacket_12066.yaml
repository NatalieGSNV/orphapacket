- TextSection:
  - Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E (CMT1E) represents a rare subtype
      of CMT1 (see this term) characterized by a variable clinical presentation. Onset
      within the first two years of life with a delay in walking is not uncommon;
      however, onset may occur later. CMT1E is caused by point mutations in the <i>PMP22</i>
      (17p12) gene. The disease severity depends on the particular <i>PMP22</i> mutation,
      with some cases being very mild and even resembling hereditary neuropathy with
      liability to pressure palsies, while others having an earlier onset with a more
      severe phenotype (reminiscent of Dejerine-Sottas syndrome; see these terms)
      than that seen in CMT1A, caused by gene duplication. These severe cases may
      also report deafness and much slower motor nerve conduction velocities compared
      to CMT1A patients.
