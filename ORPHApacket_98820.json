Focal seizures emanate from different cortical locations (temporal, frontal, centroparietal, parietal, parietaloccipital, occipital) in different family members, but for each individual a single focus remains constant throughout lifetime. Seizure type (tonic, tonic-clonic or hyperkinetic) and severity varies among family members and tends to decrease (but do not disappear) during adulthood. Many patients have an aura and show automatisms during diurnal seizures whereas others have nocturnal seizures. Most individuals are of normal intelligence but patients with intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder have been described."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"3","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"604364","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"617116","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"617118","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"FFEVF"},{"lang":"en","label":"Familial partial epilepsy with variable foci"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"3","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"DEP domain containing 5"}],"Symbol":"DEPDC5","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"18423"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614191"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410295","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (loss of function) in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"NPR2 like, GATOR1 complex subunit"}],"Symbol":"NPRL2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"607072"},{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"24969"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410295","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (loss of function) in"}]}]},{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"NPR3 like, GATOR1 complex subunit"}],"Symbol":"NPRL3","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"14124"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"600928"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410295","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (loss of function) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
