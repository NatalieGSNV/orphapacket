Coarse facial features (including hypertelorism and long hypoplastic philtrum) and bilateral cryptorchidism (in males) are also commonly reported. Additional manifestations include abnormal gastrointestinal motility (resulting in constipation, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux and dysphagia), gait disturbances, strabismus and ventricular septal defects."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"616682","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"SSM syndrome"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"exostosin glycosyltransferase 2"}],"Symbol":"EXT2","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"3513"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"608210"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"410295","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) (loss of function) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
