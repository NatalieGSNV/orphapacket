The group encompasses (idiopathic) acquired sideroblastic anemia and constitutional sideroblastic anemias (see these terms). The latter include syndromic sideroblastic anemias such as Pearson syndrome, mitochondrial mypathy and sideroblastic anemias, x-linked sideroblastic anemia-ataxia, thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome and nonsyndromic sideroblastic anemias comprising x-linked and autosomal recessive sideroblastic anemias (see these terms)."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"6","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal dominant"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Mitochondrial inheritance"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"X-linked dominant"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"X-linked recessive"}]}]}]}]}
