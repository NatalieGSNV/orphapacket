- TextSection:
  - Contents: Hypothalamic hamartomas with gelastic seizures is a rare cerebral malformation
      with epilepsy syndrome characterized by early-onset gelastic (i.e. ictal laughter)
      or dacrystic (i.e., ictal crying) seizures due to non-neoplastic developmental
      malformation - hypothalamic hamartomas. In many patients, seizures progress
      to other seizure types including focal and generalized seizures, with concomitant
      cognitive decline and behavioral disorders. Some patients also present a precocious
      puberty.
