- TextSection:
  - Contents: Methylmalonic aciduria due to transcobalamin receptor defect is a rare
      metabolite absorption and transport disorder characterized by a moderate increase
      of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in the blood and urine due to decreased cellular
      uptake of cobalamin resulting from decreased transcobalamin receptor function.
      Patients are usually asymptomatic however, screening reveals increased C3-acylcarnitine
      and MMA in plasma. Serum homocysteine levels may vary from normal to moderately
      elevated and retinal vascular occlusive disease, resulting in severe visual
      loss, has been reported.
