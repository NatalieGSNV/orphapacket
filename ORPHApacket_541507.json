Infants typically present with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, dyspnea, irritability, hyperhidrosis, heart murmurs, tachypnea, tachycardia and\/or chest pain while adults usually associate dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and intolerance to physical exercise. Sudden death may occur due to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, valvular insufficiencies or ventricular arrhythmias. The majority of cases reported are of an ALCAPA, while ARCAPA is rarely observed."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"ACAPA"}]}]}]}
