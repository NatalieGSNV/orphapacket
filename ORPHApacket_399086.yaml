- TextSection:
  - Contents: Finnish upper limb-onset distal myopathy is a rare, genetic distal myopathy
      characterized by slowly progressive distal to proximal limb muscle weakness
      and atrophy, with characteristic early involvement of thenar and hypothenar
      muscles. Patients present with clumsiness of the hands and stumbling in the
      fourth to fifth decade of life, and later develop steppage gait and contractures
      of the hands. Progressive fatty degeneration affects intrinsic muscles of the
      hands, gluteus medium and both anterior and posterior compartment muscles of
      the distal lower extremities, with later involvement of forearm muscles, triceps,
      infraspinatus and the proximal lower limb muscles. Asymmetry of muscle involvement
      is common.
