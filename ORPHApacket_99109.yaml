- TextSection:
  - Contents: Persistent left superior vena cava connecting to the left-sided atrium
      is a rare, congenital vascular malformation of the major vessels characterized
      by a persitent left superior vena cava which drains directly to the left atrium,
      without passing through the coronary sinus (that may be absent in some cases).
      Patients are usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, however hypoxia,
      cyanosis, murmurs, palpitations, cardiac structural anomalies (e.g. atrial septal
      defect, bicuspid aortic valve, cor triatrium) and risk of paradoxical embolization
      may be associated.
