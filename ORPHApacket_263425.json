In 2\/3 cases the ipsilateral sclera is affected. Nevus of Ota usually remains stable once adulthood is reached but an increased risk of glaucoma and uveal melanoma may be observed. Extracutaneous lesions may also occur in cornea, retina, tympanum, nasal mucosa, pharynx, palate. Nevus of Ota occurs as solitary conditions but seldom may occur together with the nevus of Ito or nevus spilus."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Nevus fusculoceruleus ophthalmomaxillaris"}]}]}]}
