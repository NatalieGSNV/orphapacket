- TextSection:
  - Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 7 is a rare mitochondrial
      disease due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized by
      a variable phenotype that includes onset in infancy or early childhood of failure
      to thrive and psychomotor regression (after initial normal development), as
      well as ocular manifestations (such as ptosis, nystagmus, optic atrophy, ophthalmoplegia
      and reduced vision). Additional manifestations include bulbar paresis with facial
      weakness, hypotonia, difficulty chewing, dysphagia, mild dysarthria, ataxia,
      global muscle atrophy, and areflexia. It has a relatively slow disease progression
      with patients often living into the third decade of life.
