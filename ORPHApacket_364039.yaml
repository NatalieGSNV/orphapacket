- TextSection:
  - Contents: Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma is a very rare Epstein-Barr virus-associated
      malignant lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by a chronic, recurrent,
      vesiculopapular rash, which subsequently ulcerates and scars, located mainly
      on sun-exposed areas and which is associated with systemic manifestations, such
      as fever, weight loss, asthenia, facial edema, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy,
      hepatosplenomegaly and/or increased liver enzymes. Hypersensitivity to mosquito
      bites has been associated and an increased risk of developing systemic lymphoma
      has been reported.
