- TextSection:
  - Contents: Orgasm-induced seizures is a rare neurologic disease characterized by
      complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, or idiopathic
      primarily generalized epilepsy, triggered by sexual orgasm. Seizures usually
      start immediately, shortly after or a few hours after the achievement of orgasm,
      last a few seconds or minutes, and are followed, in very rare cases, by intense
      migraine.
