- TextSection:
  - Contents: Fetal encasement syndrome is a rare, lethal developmental defect during
      embryogenesis characterized by severe fetal malformations, including craniofacial
      dysmorphism (abnormal cyst in the cranial region, hypoplastic eyeballs, two
      orifices in the nasal region separated by a nasal septum, abnormal orifice replacing
      the mouth), omphalocele and immotile, hypoplastic limbs encased under an abnormal,
      transparent, membrane-like skin. Additional features include absence of adnexal
      structures of the skin on the outer aspect of the limbs, as well as underdeveloped
      skeletal muscles and bones. Association with tetralogy of Fallot, horse-shoe
      kidneys and diaphragm and lung lobulation defects is reported.
