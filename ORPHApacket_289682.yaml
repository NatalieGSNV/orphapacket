- TextSection:
  - Contents: Lymphoepithelial-like carcinoma is a rare, malignant epithelial tumor,
      composed of undifferentiated epithelial cells with dense lymphoid stroma, mimicking
      lymphoepithelioma. It often shows association with Epstein-Barr virus infection
      and can develop in various organs, such as the nasopharynx, stomach, skin, breast
      and lungs, among others. The presenting symptoms, as well as the radiologic
      features, are usually nonspecific and depend on the affected site and organ.
