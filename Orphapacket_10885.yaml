- TextSection:
  - Contents: Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare benign proliferative
      disorder of the synovial membrane primarily affecting young adults (with a peak
      age of onset in the second to fourth decade of life) characterized by proliferative,
      locally invasive tumor-like lesions, usually involving a single joint, tendon
      sheath or bursa (most commonly the joints of the knee and hip and rarely others
      such as the ankle, shoulder and temporomandibular joints). It presents with
      pain and limitation of motion along with swelling, heat and tenderness over
      the involved joint, eventually leading to arthritic degeneration and significant
      locomotor deficit, if left untreated. PVNS can recur in patients even after
      treatment.
