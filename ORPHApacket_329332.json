Hands and feet present with long fusiform fingers, campto-clinodactyly and crowded toes while craniofacial dysmorphism includes microcephaly, broad forehead, thin eyebrows, upslanting palpebral fissures, large ears with prominent antihelix, prominent nose, long philtrum, thin upper lip vermillion and prominent lower lip. Neurological signs include hypotonia, brisk reflexes, dystonic-like movements and truncal ataxia and imaging shows cerebellar hypoplasia and simplified gyral pattern."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614407","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Microcephaly-cerebellar hypoplasia-congenital heart conduction defect syndrome"}]}]}]}
