  - Contents: A rare, genetic or acquired, dermis elastic tissue disorder characterized
      by asymptomatic, solitary or multiple, firm, skin-colored to yellowish papules
      or nodules of variable size that are disseminated or grouped in clusters and
      typically located on the trunk, buttocks, thighs or face, among others. Histologically,
      focal increase of thickened, tortuous elastic fibers in the reticular dermis,
      without signs of degeneration, is reported. Isolated cases, as well as cases
      associated with osteopoikilosis (Buschke-Ollendorf syndrome), may be observed.
