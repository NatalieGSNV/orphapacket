- TextSection:
  - Contents: Partial septate uterus is a rare, non-syndromic uterovaginal malformation
      characterized by a uterus that has a longitudinal septum which extends from
      the uterine fundus and does not reach the internal cervical os (variable lengths
      and widths may be observed). Although frequently asymptomatic, an increased
      risk of poor reproductive outcome has been observed. Urinary tract abnormalities
      are very rarely associated.
