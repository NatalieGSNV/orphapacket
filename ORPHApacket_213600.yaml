  - Contents: Adenosarcoma of the corpus uteri is a rare subtype of mixed epithelial-mesenchymal
      tumor, often presenting as a large, exophytic polypoid lesion, which may extend
      through the cervix, composed of benign or atypical epithelium and low-grade
      malignant stroma. It usually presents with dysfunctional bleeding or vaginal
      discharge and less often abdominal pain. Association with long-term unopposed
      estrogen therapy, tamoxifen therapy and a history of pelvic radiation has been
