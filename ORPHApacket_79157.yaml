- TextSection:
  - Contents: 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (or Short/branched-chain acyl-coA
      dehydrogenase; SBCAD) deficiency is characterized by increased urinary excretion
      of 2-methylbutyrylglycine, and increased whole blood and plasma concentrations
      of 2-methylbutyryl (C5) carnitine. It has been described in less than 30 patients,
      mostly from the Hmong population, an ethnic group of Chinese origin. The phenotype
      is not well defined, ranging from completely asymptomatic patients to those
      with muscle hypotonia, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, lethargy, hypoglycemia,
      and metabolic acidosis. The disorder is transmitted as an autosomal recessive
      trait. The SBCAD enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA to tiglyl-CoA
      in the isoleucine catabolic pathway. Mutations in the <i>SBCAD</i> gene (located
      on chromosome 10q25-26) have been reported in affected patients. Treatment includes
      carnitine supplementation and a low-protein diet.
