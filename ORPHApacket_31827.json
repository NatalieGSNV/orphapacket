Patients may develop potentially life-threatening complications such as hepatic dysfunction, acute tubular necrosis and renal insufficiency, and respiratory failure (due to pulmonary fibrosis) due to its inherent toxicity and lack of effective treatment. Intoxication via inhalation, injection and dermal or mucus contact have also been reported."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
