- TextSection:
  - Contents: Classic paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis is a rare neuroimmunological
      disorder characterized by the sudden onset of seizures, progressive memory impairment
      (which may develop into dementia) and psychiatric manifestations (e.g. depression,
      personality changes, loss of social inhibition) associated with cancer (most
      commonly small-cell carcinoma of the lung) in the absence of tumor cell invasion
      of the nervous system. Other reported features include ataxia, dystonia, paresthesia,
      tremors, paranoid ideation, and hallucinations. The presence of antibodies that
      act on neuronal antigens (such as anti-Hu, anti-Ma2, anti-amphiphysin) are typically
      observed.
