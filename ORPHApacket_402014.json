Frequently associated with multilineage bone marrow dysplasia, it usually presents with anemia, thrombocytopenia (often pancytopenia), and other nonspecific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue, bleeding and bruising, recurrent infections, bone pain) and\/or extramedullary site involvement (gingivitis, splenomegaly).
