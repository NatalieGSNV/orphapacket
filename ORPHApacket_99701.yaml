  - Contents: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is a rare epilepsy
      syndrome defined by seizures originating in limbic areas of the mesial temporal
      lobe, particularly in the hippocampus, amygdala, and in the parahippocampal
      gyrus and its connections, and hippocampal sclerosis, usually unilateral or
      assymetric. It is frequently associated with an initial precipitating event,
      such as febrile seizures, hypoxia, intracranial infection or head trauma, most
      often occurring in the first five years of life, followed by a latent period
      without seizures. Typical seizures consist of a characteristic aura that is
      frequently a rising epigastric sensation associated with emotional disturbances,
      illusions, and autonomic symptoms (widened pupils, palpitations), progressive
      impairment of consciousness, oro-alimentary automatisms (lip smacking, chewing,
      licking, tooth grinding), behavioral arrest, head deviation, dystonic postures,
      hand and verbal automatisms. Seizures are followed by postictal dysfunction.
      Initially, seizures are easily controlled with antiepileptic drugs, later they
      frequently become refractory and associated with progressive behavioral changes
      and memory deficits.
