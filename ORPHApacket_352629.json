Characteristic histological features of lung tissue include paucity of alveolar wall capillaries, alveolar wall thickening, muscular hypertrophy of the pulmonary arteries, and malposition of the small pulmonary veins. Various additional congenital malformations may be associated, mostly gastrointestinal (intestinal malrotation and atresias, anular pancreas), genitourinary (dilatation of urinary tracts, duplicated uterus) and cardiovascular anomalies (hypoplastic left heart and other congenital heart defects)."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"2","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Unknown"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Del(16)(q24.1)"},{"lang":"en","label":"Monosomy 16q24.1"}]}]}]}
