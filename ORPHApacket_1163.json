Aspergilloma occurs in patients with cavitary lung disease and results in a fungal mass with variable clinical presentations from asymptomatic to life-threatening (massive hemoptysis). CNPA manifests as subacute pneumonia in patients with underlying disease. IA is disseminated aspergillosis that eventually invades other organs. Cutaneous aspergillosis is usually the dermatological manifestation of IA that manifests as erythematous-to-violaceous plaques or papules, often characterized by a central necrotic ulcer or eschar."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614079","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21541","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"BTNT (broader term maps to a narrower term)"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"All ages"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Not applicable"}]}]}]}]}
