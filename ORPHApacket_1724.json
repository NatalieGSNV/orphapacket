More severe phenotypes, with patients presenting psychomotor and speech delay, mild facial dysmorphism, cardiac (i.e. ventricular septal defect, dysplastic tricuspid mitral valve) and renal anomalies (e.g. horseshoe kidneys), have also been reported."}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"2","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Antenatal"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"2","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Mosaic trisomy chromosome 20"},{"lang":"en","label":"Trisomy 20 mosaicism"}]}]}]}
