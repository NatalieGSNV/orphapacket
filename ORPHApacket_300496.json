Craniofacial dysmorphism (prominent occiput, enlarged fontanel, fused metopic suture, upslanted palpebral fissures, overfolded helix, depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nose, malar flattening, microstomy with downturned corners, Pierre-Robin sequence, high arched palate, short neck) and other manifestions (joint contractures, hyperreflexia, dysplastic nails, developmental delay) are also observed."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"300868","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"3","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Antenatal"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Infancy"}]},{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"X-linked recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"MCAHS type 2"}]}]}]}
