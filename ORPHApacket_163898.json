Other reported features include ataxia, dystonia, paresthesia, tremors, paranoid ideation, and hallucinations. The presence of antibodies that act on neuronal antigens (such as anti-Hu, anti-Ma2, anti-amphiphysin) are typically observed."}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"1","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"Classic paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, with or without intracellular antigens"}]}]}]}
