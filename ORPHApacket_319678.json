Cerebral and cerebellar atrophy can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging and multiple choroid plexus cysts and symmetrical hyperechoic signal alterations in basal ganglia have been observed on ultrasound."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"614654","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Neonatal"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"coenzyme Q9"}],"Symbol":"COQ9","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"25302"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"612837"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
