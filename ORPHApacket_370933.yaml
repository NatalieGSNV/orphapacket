- TextSection:
  - Contents: GM3 synthase deficiency is a rare congenital disorder of glycosylation
      due to impaired synthesis of complex ganglioside species initially characterized
      by irritability, poor feeding, failure to thrive and early-onset refractory
      epilepsy, followed by postnatal growth impairment, severe developmental delay
      or developmental regression, profound intellectual disability, deafness and
      abnormalities of skin pigmentation (mostly freckle-like hyperpigmented and depigmented
      macules). Visual impairment due to cortical atrophy (visible on magnetic resonance
      imaging), choreoathetosis and hypotonic tetraparesis usually appear gradually.
      Dysmorphic facial features may be associated.
