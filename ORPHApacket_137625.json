It has been described in three siblings (two brothers and their younger sister). The older brother died at 10.5 years of age as a result of sudden cardiac arrest and the younger brother presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal heart rate and blood pressure during exercise, and muscle fatigability. The sister showed no symptoms but a lack of glycogen was identified through muscle biopsy. The syndrome is caused by homozygous missense mutations in the gene encoding muscle glycogen synthase."}],"ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"1","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"611556","DisorderMappingRelation":[{"id":"21527","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"E (exact mapping (the terms and the concepts are equivalent))"}]}]}]}],"AverageAgeOfOnsetList":[{"count":"1","AverageAgeOfOnset":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Childhood"}]}]}],"TypeOfInheritanceList":[{"count":"1","TypeOfInheritance":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Autosomal recessive"}]}]}],"SynonymList":[{"count":"5","Synonym":[{"lang":"en","label":"GSD due to muscle and heart glycogen synthase deficiency"},{"lang":"en","label":"GSD type 0b"},{"lang":"en","label":"Glycogen storage disease type 0b"},{"lang":"en","label":"Glycogenosis due to muscle and heart glycogen synthase deficiency"},{"lang":"en","label":"Glycogenosis type 0b"}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationList":[{"count":"1","DisorderGeneAssociation":[{"Gene":[{"Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"glycogen synthase 1"}],"Symbol":"GYS1","ExternalReferenceList":[{"count":"2","ExternalReference":[{"Source":"HGNC","Reference":"4706"},{"Source":"OMIM","Reference":"138570"}]}]}],"DisorderGeneAssociationType":[{"OrphaNumber":"317343","Name":[{"lang":"en","label":"Disease-causing germline mutation(s) in"}]}]}]}]}]}
