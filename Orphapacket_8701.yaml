- TextSection:
  - Contents: Urachal cyst is a congenital urachal anomaly (see this term) characterized
      by a failure of complete closure of the urachus, in which both ends are closed
      but the central lumen remains patent. It is typically asymptomatic but may become
      clinically significant when infected, presenting as a mass in the umbilical
      region accompanied by abdominal pain and fever.
