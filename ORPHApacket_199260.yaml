  - Contents: A rare, superficial fibromatosis characterized by non-malignant, locally
      invading, fibrosing tumour of differentiated fibroblasts, slowly growing subcutaneously,
      occurring predominantly distally on the extremities, especially the hands and
      feet. Histologic examination shows a multinodular pattern with large areas of
      calcification and fibrosis, and the presence of elongated spindle cells with
      hyperchromatic plump vesicular nuclei interspersed within fine bands of collagen.
